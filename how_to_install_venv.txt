 1. Create a Virtual Environment (venv)
Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + backtick ) and run:

python -m venv .venv
# or, if using a specific version
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
This will create a .venv folder in your current project directory (including for requirements.txt use).

🔄 2. Activate the Environment
On Windows, activate it with:

.\.venv\Scripts\activate
After activation, you'll see the prefix (.venv) in your terminal — you're now using the correct environment ✅

Also, upgrade pip:

python -m pip install --upgrade pip

🔁 3. Install Required Libraries
Install from file:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Or install packages manually:

pip install pandas numpy jupyter chromadb ...

📘 4. Install Jupyter + Kernel (once)

pip install jupyter ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=venv --display-name "Python (Project)"
You can replace "Python (Project)" with "Python (Neufert)", "Python (engineering_exam)", or any name you prefer.

Check installed kernels:

jupyter kernelspec list

💻 5. Select Kernel in VS Code
Open your .ipynb notebook.

In the top-right corner, click the current kernel name.

Choose:

Python (Project) ✅
✅ Done!
You're now working in a clean, isolated environment with all needed libraries. You can:

Move it between machines
Archive it
Reuse it anywhere with the same dependencies
