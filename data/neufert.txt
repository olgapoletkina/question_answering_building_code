This book provides architects and designers with a concise 
source of core information needed to form a framework for 
the detailed planning of any building project. The objective is 
to save time for building designers during their basic inves- 
tigations. The information includes the principles of the 
design process, basic information on siting, servicing and 
constructing buildings, as well as illustrations and descrip- 
tions of a wide range of building types. Designers need to be 
well informed about the requirements for all the constituent 
parts of new projects in order to ensure that their designs 
satisfy the requirements of the briefs and that the buildings 
conform to accepted standards and regulations. 

The extended contents list shows how the book is orga- 
nised and the order of the subjects discussed. To help read- 
ers to identify relevant background information easily, the 
Bibliography (page 589) and list of related British and inter- 
national standards (page 595) have been structured in a way 
that mirrors the organisation of the main sections of the 
book. 

To avoid repetition and keep the book to a manageable 
length, the different subjects are covered only once in full. 
Readers should therefore refer to several sections to glean all 
of the information they require. For instance, a designer 
wanting to prepare a scheme for a college will need to refer to 
other sections apart from that on colleges, such as - 
draughting guidelines; multistorey buildings; the various 
sections on services and environmental control; restaurants 
for the catering facilities; hotels, hostels and flats for the 
student accommodation; office buildings for details on 
working environments; libraries; car-parks; disabled access 
(in the housing and residential section); indoor and outdoor 
sports facilities; gardens; as well as details on doors, windows, 
stairs, and the section on construction management, etc. 

Readers should note that the majority of the material is 
from European contributors and this means that the detail

ABOUT THIS BOOK 


on, for example, climate and daylight is from the perspective 
of a temperate climate in the northern hemisphere. The 
conditions at the location of the proposed building will 
always have to be ascertained from specific information on 
the locality. A similar situation is to be seen in the section on 
roads, where the illustrations show traffic driving on the 
right-hand side of the road. Again, local conditions must be 
taken into consideration for each individual case. 

The terminology and style of the text is UK English and this 
clearly will need to be taken into account by readers accus- 
tomed to American English. These readers will need to be 
aware that, for example, ‘lift’ has been used in place of 
‘elevator’ and ‘ground floor’ is used instead of ‘first floor’ 
(and ‘first floor’ for ‘second’, etc.). 

The data and examples included in the text are drawn from 
a wide range of sources and as a result a combination of 
conventions is used throughout for dimensions. The mea- 
surements shown are all metric but a mixture of metres, 
centimetres and millimetres is used and they are in the main 
not identified. 

Readers will also find some superscript numbers asso- 
ciated with the measurements. Where these appear by 
dimensions in metres with centimetres, for instance, they 
represent the additional millimetre component of the mea- 
sure (e.g. 1.26° denotes 1m, 26cm, 5mm). Anybody familiar 
with the metric system will not find this troublesome and 
those people who are less comfortable with metric units can 
use the Conversion Tables given on pages 611 to 627 to 
clarify any ambiguities. 

The plans and diagrams of buildings do not have scales as 
the purpose here is to show the general layout and express 
relationships between different spaces, making exact scaling 
unnecessary. However, all relevant dimensions are given on 
the detailed drawings and diagrams of installations, to assist 
in the design of specific spaces and constructions.

Throughout history man has created things to be of 
service to him using measurements relating to his body. 
Until relatively recent times, the limbs of humans were 
the basis for all the units of measurement. Even today 
many people would have a better understanding of the 
size of an object if they were told that it was so many men 
high, so many paces long, so many feet wider or so many 
heads bigger. These are concepts we have from birth, the 
sizes of which can be said to be in our nature. However, 
the introduction of metric dimensions put an end to that 
way of depicting our world. 

Using the metric scale, architects have to try to create 
a mental picture that is as accurate and as vivid as 
possible. Clients are doing the same when they measure 
rooms on a plan to envisage the dimensions in reality. 
Architects should familiarise themselves with the size of 
rooms and the objects they contain so that they can 
picture and convey the real size of yet-to-be designed 
furniture, rooms or buildings in each line they draw and 
each dimension they measure. 

We immediately have an accurate idea of the size of an 
object when we see a man (real or imaginary) next to it. It 
is a sign of our times that pictures of buildings and rooms 
presented in our trade and professional journals are too 
often shown without people present in them. From 
pictures alone, we often obtain a false idea of the size of 
these rooms and buildings and are surprised how 
different they appear in reality — frequently, they seem 
much smaller than expected. One of the reasons for the 
failure of buildings to have cohesive relationships with 
one another is because the designers have based their 
work on different arbitrary scales and not on the only true 
scale, namely that of human beings. 

If this is ever to be changed, architects and designers 
must be shown how these thoughtlessly accepted 
measurements have developed and how they can be 
avoided. They have to understand the relationship 
between the sizes of human limbs and what space a 
person requires in various postures and whilst moving 
around. They must also know the sizes of objects, 
utensils, clothing etc. in everyday use to be able to 
determine suitable dimensions for containers and 
furniture. 

In addition, architects and designers have to know 
what space humans need between furniture — both in the 
home and in the workplace — as well as how the furniture 
can best be positioned. Without this knowledge, they will 
be unable to create an environment in which no space is 
wasted and people can comfortably perform their duties 
or enjoy relaxation time. 

Finally, architects and designers must know the 
dimensions for minimum space requirements for people 
moving around in, for example, railways and vehicles. 
These minimum space requirements produce strongly 
fixed impressions from which, often unconsciously, other 
dimensions of spaces are derived. 

Man is not simply a physical being, who needs room. 
Emotional response is no less important; the way people 
feel about any space depends crucially on how it is 
divided up, painted, lit, entered, and furnished. 

Starting out from all these considerations and 
perceptions, Ernst Neufert began in 1926 to collect 
methodically the experiences gained in a varied practice 
and teaching activities. He developed a ‘theory of 
planning’ based on the human being and provided a 
framework for assessing the dimensions of buildings and 
their constituent parts. The results were embodied in this

book. Many questions of principle were examined, 
developed and weighed against one another for the first 
time. 

In the current edition up-to-date technical options are 
included to the fullest extent and common standards are 
taken into consideration. Description is kept to the 
absolute minimum necessary and is augmented or 
replaced as far as possible by drawings. Creative building 
designers can thus obtain the necessary information for 
design in an orderly, brief, and coherent form, which 
otherwise they would have to collect together laboriously 
from many reference sources or obtain by detailed 
measurement of completed buildings. Importance has 
been attached to giving only a summary; the fundamental 
data and experiences are compared with finished 
buildings only if it is necessary to provide a suitable 
example. 

By and large, apart from the requirements of pertinent 
standards, each project is different and so should be 
studied, approached and designed afresh by the architect. 
Only in this way can there be lively progress within the 
spirit of the times. However, executed projects lend 
themselves too readily to imitation, or establish 
conventions from which architects of similar projects may 
find difficulty in detaching themselves. If creative 
architects are given only constituent parts, as is the 
intention here, they are compelled to weave the 
components together into their own imaginative and 
unified construction. 

Finally, the component parts presented here have been 
systematically researched from the literature to provide 
the data necessary for individual building tasks, checked 
out on well-known buildings of a similar type and, where 
necessary, determined from models and experiments. 
The objective of this is always that of saving practising 
building planners from having to carry out all of these 
basic investigations, thereby enabling them to devote 
themselves to the important creative aspects of the task.

DOCUMENTATION AND DRAWINGS 


The format of documentation (whether in the form of 
plans, reports, letters, envelopes etc.) has, apart from in the 
USA, generally been standardised to conform to the 
internationally accepted (ISO) series of paper sheet sizes in 
the ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’ ranges. These standard paper 
formats are derived from a rectangular sheet with an area 
of 1m2. Using the ‘golden square’, the lengths of the sides 
are chosen as x = 0.841m and y = 1.189m such that: 
Xxxy=1 
xty = 1:V2 
This forms the basis for the A series. Maintaining the same 
(4) GB) ratio of length to width, the sheet sizes are worked out by

During book-binding, a further trim is usually necessary, 
giving pages somewhat smaller than the standard format

the RA or SRA sizes and this has an allowance for 
trimming, which allows the final page sizes to match the 
standard formats.

DOCUMENTATION AND DRAWINGS 


The use of standard drawing formats makes it easier for 
architects to lay out drawings for discussion in the design 
office or on the building site, and also facilitates posting and 
filing. The trimmed, original drawing or print must therefore 
conform to the formats of the ISO A series. > 3)- ©) 

The box for written details should be the following 
distance from the edge of the drawing: 

for formats A0-A3 10mm 

for formats A4—A6 5mm 
For small drawings, a filing margin of up to 25mm can be 
used, with the result that the usable area of the finished 
format will be smaller. 

As an exception, narrow formats can be arrived at by 
stringing together a row of identical or adjacent formats out 
of the format range. 

From normal roll widths, the following sizes can be used 
to give formats in the A series: 

for drawing paper, tracing paper 1500, 1560 mm 
(derived from this 250, 1250, 660, 900 mm) 
for print paper 650, 900, 1200 mm 
If all the drawing formats up to AO are to be cut from a 
paper web, a roll width of at least 900 mm will be necessary. 

Drawings which are to be stored in A4 box files should 
be folded as follows: > 

(1) The writing box must always be uppermost, in the 
correct place and clearly visible. 

(2)On starting to fold, the width of 210 mm (fold 1) 
must always be maintained, and it is useful to use a 
210 x 297 mm template. 

(3) Fold 2 is a triangular fold started 297 mm up from the 
bottom left-hand corner, so that on the completely 
folded drawing only the left bottom field, indicated 
with a cross, will be punched or clamped. 

(4) The drawing is next folded back parallel to side ‘a’ 
using a 185 x 298mm template. Any remaining area 
is concertina-folded so as to even out the sheet size 
and this leaves the writing box on the top surface. If 
it is not possible to have even folds throughout, the 
final fold should simply halve the area left (e.g. A1 
fold 5, AO fold 7). Any longer standard formats can be 
folded in a similar way. 

(5) The resulting strip should be folded from side ‘b’ to 
give a final size of 210 x 297 mm. 

To reinforce holes and filing edges, a piece of A5 size 
cardboard (148 x 210 mm) can be glued to the back of the 
punched part of the drawing.

Scales 


The main scale of the drawing must be given in large type in the box for written 
details. Other scales must be in smaller type and these scales must be repeated 
next to their respective diagrams. All objects should be drawn to scale; where the 
drawing is not to scale the dimensions must be underlined. As far as possible, use 
the following scales: 
for construction drawings: 1:1, 1:2.5, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, 1:25, 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, 1:250 
for site layouts: 1:500, 1:1000, 1:2000, 1:2500, 1:5000, 1:10000, 1:25000. 


Measurement Figures and Other Inscriptions 


In continental Europe, for structural engineering and architectural drawings, 
dimensions under 1 m are generally given in cm and those above 1 m in m. 
However, recently the trend has been to give all dimensions in mm, and this is 
standard practice in the UK. 

Chimney stack flues, pressurised gas pipes and air ducts are shown with their 
internal dimensions as a fraction (width over length) and, assuming they are 
circular, by the use of the symbol @ for diameter. 

Squared timber is also shown as a fraction written as width over height. 

The rise of stairs is shown along the course of the centre-line, with the tread 
depth given underneath (~ p. 13). 

Window and door opening dimensions are shown, as with stairs, along the central 
axis. The width is shown above, and the internal height below, the line (— p. 13). 

Details of floor heights and other heights are measured from the finished floor 
level of the ground floor (FFL: zero height +0.00). 

Room numbers are written inside a circle and surface area details, in m2, are 
displayed in a square or a rectangle —> @). 

Section lines in plan views are drawn in chain dot lines and are labelled with 
capital letters, usually in alphabetical order, to indicate where the section cuts 
through the building. As well as standard dimensional arrows = (5) oblique arrows 
and extent marks — © + (@ are commonly used. The position of the dimensional 
figures must be such that the viewer, standing in front of the drawing, can read the 
dimensions as easily as possible, without having to turn the drawing round, and 
they must be printed in the same direction as the dimension lines.

Designers use drawings and 
illustrations to communicate 
information in a factual, 
unambiguous and geometric 
form that can be understood 
anywhere in the world. With 
good drawing skills it is simpler 
for designers to explain their 
proposals and also give clients a 
convincing picture of how the 
finished project will look. Unlike 
painting, construction drawing 
is a means to an end and this 
differentiates diagrams/working 
drawings and illustrations from 
artistic works. 

Sketch pads with graph 
paper having 0.5cm squares are 
ideal for freehand sketches to 
scale —» (1). For more accurate 
sketches, millimetre graph 
paper should be used. This has 
thick rules for centimetre 
divisions, thinner rules for half 
centimetres and fine rules for 
the millimetre divisions. 
Different paper is used for 
drawing and sketching accord- 
ing to standard modular 
coordinated construction and 
engineering grids > (@). Use 
tracing paper for sketching with 
a soft lead pencil. 

Suitable sheet sizes for 
drawings can be cut straight 
from a roll, single pages being 
torn off using a T-square or cut 
on the underside of the T-square 
— (3). Construction drawings are 
done in hard pencil or ink on 
clear, tear-resistant tracing paper, 
bordered with protected edges —> 
@) and stored in drawers or hung 
in vertical plan chests. 

Fix the paper on a simple 
drawing board (designed for 
standard formats), made of 
limewood or poplar, using 
drawing pins with conical points 
~» ©). First turn over 2cm width 
of the drawing paper edge, 
which can later be used as the 
filing edge (see p. 4), for this lifts 
the T-square a little during 
drawing and_ prevents. the 
drawing being smudged by the 
T-square itself. (For the same 
reason, draw from top. to 
bottom.) The drawing can be 
fixed with drafting tape rather 
than tacks > ©) if a plastic 
underlay backing is used. 

The T-square has. tradit- 
ionally been the basic tool of the 
designer, with special T-squares 
used to draw lines at varying 
angles. They are provided with 
octameter and centimetre 
divisions > (J). In general, 
however, the T-square has been 
replaced by parallel motion 
rulers mounted on the drawing 
board > (6). Other drawing aids 
include’ different measuring 
scales > (8), 45° set squares with 
millimetre and degree divisions,

To maintain accuracy” in 
construction drawings req- 
uires practice. For instance, it 
iS essential to hold the T- 
Square properly and use 
pencils and pens in the 
correct manner. Another 
important factor in. elimin- 
ating inaccuracy is keeping a 
sharp pencil point. There are 
various drawing aids that can 
help: grip pencils, for 
example, are suitable for 
leads with diameters of 2mm 
Or more and propelling 
pencils are useful for thinner 
leads. Lead hardnesses from 
6B to 9H are available. Many 
models of drafting pens are 
available, both refillable and 
disposable, and offer a wide 
range of line thicknesses. For 
rubbing out ink use mech- 
anical erasers, erasing knives 
or razor blades whereas non- 
smear rubbers should be used 
for erasing pencil. For 
drawings with tightly packed 
lines use eraser templates 
>). 

Write text preferably 
without aids. On technical 
drawings use lettering stencils, 
writing either with drafting 
pens or using a stipple brush 


- (2). Transfer lettering 
(Letraset etc.) is also 
commonly used. The 


international standard for 
lettering ISO 3098/1. 

To make the designer's 
intentions clear, diagrams 
should be drawn to con- 
vincingly portray the finished 
building. Isometry can be 
used to replace a bird’s eye 
view if drawn to the scale of 
<1:500 . a3 and perspective

CAD application in architectural design 

The acronym CAD usually means either computer-aided 
design or computer-aided draughting. CADD is sometimes 
used to mean computer-aided draughting and design. 
Computer-aided design is a highly valued technique because 
it not only enables a substantial increase in productivity but 
also helps to achieve neater and clearer drawings than those 
produced using the conventional manual drafting techniques 
described in the preceding pages. Standard symbols or 
building elements can be compiled as a library of items, 
stored and used to create new designs. There is also a 
possibility of minimising the repetition of tasks by linking 
CAD data directly with other computer systems, i.e. 
scheduling databases, bills of quantities etc. 

Another advantage of CAD is that it minimises the need 
for storage space: electronic storage and retrieval of 
graphic and data features clearly requires a fraction of the 
space needed for a paper-based system. Drawings currently 
being worked on may be stored in the CAD program 
memory whereas finished design drawings that are not 
immediately required may be archived in high-capacity 
electronic storage media, such as Magnetic tapes or 
compact disks. 

A drawback relating to the sophisticated technology 
required for professional CAD has been the high expense of 
the software packages, many of which would only be run on 
large, costly computer systems. However, various cheap, 
though still relatively powerful, packages are now available 
and these will run on a wide range of low-cost personal 
computers. 


CAD software 

A CAD software package consists of the CAD program, 
which contains the program files and accessories such as 
help files and interfaces with other programs, and an 
extensive reference manual. In the past, the program files 
were stored on either 51/4" or 31/2" floppy disks. The low 
storage capacity of the 51/4" floppy disks and their 
Susceptibility to damage has rendered them obsolete. 
Besides their higher storage density, 31/2" disks are stronger 
and easier to handle. Nowadays, the program files are 
usually stored on compact discs (CD-ROM) because of their 
high capacity and the ever increasing size of programs; they 
are even capable of storing several programs. 

When installing a CAD program onto the computer 
system, the program files must be copied onto the hard disk 
of the computer. In the past, CAD was run on 
microcomputers using the MS-DOS operating system only. 
New versions of the CAD programs are run using MS-DOS 
and/or Microsoft Windows operating systems.

Hardware requirements 

Once the desired CAD software has been selected, it is 
important to ensure that the appropriate hardware 
(equipment) needed to run the program is in place. A typical 
computer system usually includes the following hardware: 


Visual Display Unit (VDU): Also called a screen or monitor, 
these are now always full-colour displays. The level of 
resolution will dictate how clear and neat the design 
appears on the screen. For intricate design work it is better 
to use a large, high-resolution screen. The prices of such 
graphic screens have fallen substantially in recent years 
making them affordable to a wide range of businesses and 
they are hence becoming commonplace. In the past, using 
CAD required two screens, one for text and the other for 
graphics. This is not necessary now because some of the 
latest CAD programs have a ‘flip screen’ facility that allows 
the user to alternate between the graphics and text display. 
In addition, the Windows version of some CAD programs 
also has a re-sizable text display that may be viewed in 
parallel with the graphics display. 


Disk drives and disks: The most usual combination of disk 
drives for desktop CAD systems initially was one hard drive 
and one 31/2" floppy drive. The storage capacity of hard 
disks increased rapidly throughout the 1990s, from early 40 
MB (megabyte) standard hard drives to Capacities 
measured in gigabytes (GB) by the end of the decade. The 
storage capability of floppy disks is now generally far too 
restrictive and this has led to the universal addition of 
compact disc drives in new PCs. These can hold up to 
650MB. This storage limitation has also led to the use of 
stand-alone zip drives and CD writers (or CD burners) to 
allow large files to be saved easily. 


Keyboard: Virtually every computer is supplied with a 
standard alphanumeric keyboard. This is a very common 
input device in CAD but it has an intrinsic drawback: it is a 
relatively slow method of moving the cursor around the 
screen and selecting draughting options. For maximum 
flexibility and speed, therefore, the support of other input 
devices is required. 


Mouse: The advantage of the mouse over the keyboard as 
an input device in CAD is in speeding up the movement of 
the cursor around the screen. The mouse is fitted with a 
button which allows point locations on the screen to be 
specified and commands from screen menus (and icons in 
the Windows system) to be selected. There are several 
types of mouse, but nowadays a standard CAD mouse has 
two buttons: one used for PICKing and the other for 
RETURNing.

Windows are always drawn with the niche shown on the

Revolving doors are often used in place of lobbies to 
give a draught-free entrance. However, they restrict 
through-traffic so the arrangement should allow the door 
flaps to be folded away during peak times. 

Wooden construction is suitable for single flights of 
stairs, whereas double flights generally require stone or 
concrete. 

In every plan view of a storey, the horizontal section 
through the staircase is displayed about 1/3 of the storey 
height above the floor. The steps are to be numbered 
continuously from +0.00 upwards and downwards. The 
numbers for the steps that lie below +0.00 are given the 
prefix — (minus). The numbers start on the first step and 
finish on the landing. The centre-line begins at the start with 
a circle and ends at the exit with an arrow (including for the 
basement).

Man’s dimensional relationships 


The oldest known code of dimensional relationships of 
man was found in a burial chamber of the pyramids near 
Memphis and are estimated to date back to roughly 3000 
Bc. Certainly since then, scientists and artists have been 
trying hard to refine human proportional relationships. 

We know about the proportional systems of the Empire 
of the Pharaohs, of the time of Ptolemy, the Greeks and the 
Romans, and even the system of Polycletes, which for a 
long time was applied as the standard, the details given by 
Alberti, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and the people of 
the Middle Ages. In particular, the work of Diirer is known 
throughout the world. In all of these works, the 
calculations for a man’s body were based on the lengths of 
heads, faces or feet. These were then subdivided and 
brought into relationship with each other, so that they 
were applicable throughout general life. Even within our 
own lifetimes, feet and ells have been in common use as 
measurements. 

The details worked out by Durer became a common 
standard and were used extensively. He started with the 
height of man and expressed the subdivisions as 
fractions: 








MAN: THE UNIVERSAL STANDARD 


Yah = 


the whole of the top half of the body, from the 

crotch upwards 

1/4h = leg length from the ankle to the knee and from the 

chin to the navel 

length of foot 

1/g8h = head length from the hair parting to the bottom of 
the chin, distance between the nipples 

io h= face height and width (including the ears), hand 
length to the wrist 

1/12 h= face width at the level of the bottom of the nose, leg 
width (above the ankle) and so on. 

The sub-divisions go up to 1/40 h.

During the last century, A. Zeising, brought greater 
clarity with his investigations of the dimensional 
relationship of man’s proportions. He made exact 
measurements and comparisons on the basis of the golden 
section. Unfortunately, this work did not receive the 
attention it deserved until recently, when a significant 
researcher in this field, E. Moessel, endorsed Zeising’s work 
by making thorough tests carried out following his 
methods. From 1945 onwards, Le Corbusier used for all his 
projects the sectional relationships in accordance with the 
golden section, which he called ‘Le Modulor’ = p. 30.

Qa) - G3) Production of carbon dioxide and water vapour by humans 


The function of housing is to protect man against the weather 
and to provide an environment that maintains his well-being. 
The required inside atmosphere comprises gently moving (i.e. 
not draughty), well oxygenated air, pleasant warmth and air 
humidity and sufficient light. To provide these conditions, 
important factors are the location and orientation of the 
housing in the landscape (> p. 272) as well as the arrangement 
of spaces in the house and its type of construction. 

The prime requirements for promoting a lasting feeling of 
well-being are an insulated construction, with appropriately 
sized windows placed correctly in relation to the room 
furnishings, sufficient heating and corresponding draught-free 
ventilation. 


The need for air 

Man breathes in oxygen with the air and expels carbon dioxide 
and water vapour when he exhales. These vary in quantity 
depending on the individual's weight, food intake, activity and 
surrounding environment > @)-@). 

It has been calculated that on average human beings 
produce 0.020m3/h of carbon dioxide and 40g/h of water 
vapour. 

A carbon dioxide content between 1 and 3%o can stimulate 
deeper breathing, so the air in the dwelling should not, as far as 
possible, contain more than 1%. This means, with a single 
change of air per hour, a requirement for an air space of 32m per 
adult and 15m3 for each child. However, because the natural rate 
of air exchange in free-standing buildings, even with closed 
windows, reaches 11/2 to 2 times this amount, 16-24m? is 
sufficient (depending on the design) as a normal air space for 
adults and 8-12m3 for children. Expressed another way, with a 
room height =>2.5m, a room floor area of 6.4-9.6 m2 for each adult 
is adequate and 3.2-4.8m2 for each child. With a greater rate of 
air exchange, (e.g. sleeping with a window open, or ventilation 
via ducting), the volume of space per person for living rooms can 
be reduced to 7.5m and for bedrooms to 10m? per bed. 

Where air quality is likely to deteriorate because of naked 
lights, vapours and other pollutants (as in hospitals or factories) 
and in enclosed spaces (such as you in an auditorium), rate of 
exchange of air must be artificially boosted in order to provide 
the lacking oxygen and remove the harmful substances. 


Space heating 

The room temperature for humans at rest is at its most pleasant 
between 18° and 20°C, and for work between 15°and 18°C, 
depending on the level of activity. A human being produces 
about 1.5kcal/h per kg of body weight. An adult weighing 70kg 
therefore generates 2520kcal of heat energy per day, although 
the quantity produced varies according to the circumstances. 
For instance it increases with a drop in room temperature just 
as it does with exercise. 

When heating a room, care must be taken to ensure that low 
temperature heat is used to warm the room air on the cold side 
of the room. With surface temperatures above 70-80°C decom- 
position can take place, which may irritate the mucous 
membrane, mouth and pharynx and make the air feel too dry. 
Because of this, steam heating and iron stoves, with their high 
surface temperatures, are not suitable for use in blocks of flats.

ROOM CLIMATE 


In the same way as the earth has a climate, the insides of buildings also 
have a climate, with measurable values for air pressure, humidity, 
temperature, velocity of air circulation and ‘internal sunshine’ in the form 
of radiated heat. Efficient control of these factors leads to optimum room 
comfort and contributes to man’s overall health and ability to perform 
whatever tasks he is engaged in. Thermal comfort is experienced when 
the thermal processes within the body are in balance (i.e. when the body 
manages its thermal regulation with the minimum of effort and the heat 
dissipated from the body corresponds with the equilibrium loss of heat 
to the surrounding area). 


Temperature regulation and heat loss from the body 

The human body can raise or lower the rate at which it loses heat using 
several mechanisms: increasing blood circulation in the = skin, 
increasing the blood circulation speed, vascular dilation and secreting 
sweat. When cold, the body uses muscular shivering to generate 
additional heat. 

Heat is lost from the body in three main ways: conduction, 
convection and radiation. Conduction is the process of heat transfer from 
one surface to another surface when they are in contact (e.g. feet in 
contact with the floor). The rate of heat transfer depends on the surface 
area in contact, the temperature differential and the thermal 
conductivities of the materials involved. Copper, for example, has a high 
thermal conductivity while that of air is low, making it a porous insulating 
material. Convection is the process of body heat being lost as the skin 
warms the surrounding air. This process is governed by the velocity of 
the circulating air in the room and the temperature differential between 
the clothed and unclothed areas of the body. Air circulation is also driven 
by convection: air warms itself by contact with hot objects (e.g. 
radiators), rises, cools off on the ceiling and sinks again. As it circulates 
the air carries dust and floating particles with it. The quicker the heating 
medium flows (e.g. water in a radiator), the quicker is the development 
of circulation. All objects, including the human body, emit heat radiation 
in accordance to temperature difference between the body surface and 
that of the ambient area. It is proportional to the power of 4 of the body's 
absolute temperature and therefore 16 times as high if the temperature 
doubles. The wavelength of the radiation also changes with temperature: 
the higher the surface temperature, the shorter the wavelength. Above 
500°C, heat becomes visible as light. The radiation below this limit is 
called infra-red/heat radiation. It radiates in all directions, penetrates the 
air without heating it, and is absorbed by (or reflected off) other solid 
bodies. In absorbing the radiation, these solid bodies (including human 
bodies) are warmed. This radiant heat absorption by the body (e.g. from 
tile stoves) is the most pleasant sensation for humans for physiological 
reasons and also the most healthy. 

Other heat exchange mechanisms used by the human body are 
evaporation of moisture from the sweat glands and breathing. The 
body surface and vapour pressure differential between the skin and 
surrounding areas are key factors here. 


Recommendations for internal climate 

An air temperature of 20—24°C is comfortable both in summer and in 
winter. The surrounding surface areas should not differ by more than 
2-3°C from the air temperature. A change in the air temperature can be 
compensated for by changing the surface temperature (e.g. with 
decreasing air temperature, increase the surface temperature). If there 
is too great a difference between the air and surface temperatures, 
excessive movement of air takes place. The main critical surfaces are 
those of the windows. 

For comfort, heat conduction to the floor via the feet must be avoided 
(i.e. the floor temperature should be 17°C or more). The surface 
temperature of the ceiling depends upon the height of the room. The 
temperature sensed by humans is somewhere near the average between 
room air temperature and that of surrounding surfaces. 

It is important to control air movement and humidity as far as 
possible. The movement can be sensed as draughts and this has the 
effect of local cooling of the body. A relative air humidity of 40-50% is 
comfortable. With a lower humidity (e.g. 30%) dust particles are liable 
to fly around. 

To maintain the quality of the air, controlled ventilation is ideal. The 
CO, content of the air must be replaced by oxygen. A CO, content of 
0.10% by volume should not be exceeded, and therefore in living 
rooms and bedrooms provide for two to three air changes per hour. 
The fresh air requirement of humans comes to about 32.0 m3/h so the 
air change in living rooms should be 0.4-0.8 times the room volume

BUILDING BIOLOGY 


For over a decade, medical doctors such as Dr Palm and Dr 
Hartmann at the Research Forum for Geobiology, Eberbach- 
Woldbrunn-Waldkatzenbach, among others, have been 
researching the effects that the environment has on people: in 
particular the effects of the ground, buildings, rooms, building 
materials and installations. 


Geological effects 
Stretched across the whole of the earth is a so-called ‘global net’ 
» (1) consisting of stationary waves, thought to be induced by the 
sun. However, its regularity, according to Hartmann, ts such that it 
suggests an earthly radiation which emanates from inside the 
earth and is effected by crystalline structures in the earth's crust, 
which orders it in such a network. The network is orientated 
magnetically, in strips of about 200mm width, from the magnetic 
north to south poles. In the central European area these appear at 
a spacing of about 2.50m. At right angles to these are other strips 
running in an east/west direction at a spacing of about 2m_- (1). 

These strips have been revealed, through experience, to 
have psychologically detrimental effects, particularly when one 
is repeatedly at rest over a point of intersection for long periods 
(e.g. when in bed) > @). In addition to this, rooms which 
correspond to the right angles of the net do not display the 
same pathogenic influences. 

These intersection points only become really pathogenic 
when they coincide with geological disturbances, such as faults 
or joints in the ground, or watercourses. The latter, in particular, 
are the most influential -» (3). Hence, there is a cumulative effect 
involved so the best situation is to make use of the undisturbed 
zone or area of 1.80x2.30m between the global strips + 4). 
According to Hartmann, the most effective action is to move the 
bed out of the disturbance area, particularly away from the 
intersection points >» (). 

According to Palm, the apparent global net of about 
2x2.50m is made up of half-distance lines. The actual network 
would be, as a result, a global net with strips at 4-5m and 5-6m 
centres, running dead straight in the east/west direction all 
round the earth. Every 7th one of these net strips is reported to 
be of a so-called 2nd order and have an influence many times 
greater than the others. Also based on sevenths, an even 
stronger disturbance zone has been identified as a so-called 3rd 
order. This is at a spacing of about 250 and 300m respectively. 
The intersection points here are also felt particularly strongly. 

Also according to Palm, in Europe there are deviations from 
the above norm of up to 15% from the north/south and the 
east/west directions. Americans have observed such strips with 
the aid of very sensitive cameras from aeroplanes flying at a 
height of several thousand meters. In addition to this, the 
diagonals also form their own global net, running north-east to 
south-west and from north-west to south-east » (6). This, too, 
has its own pattern of strong sevenths, which are about one 
quarter as strong again in their effect. 

It is stated that locating of the global strips depends on the 
reliability of the compass, and that modern building construction 
can influence the needle of the compass. Thus variations of 1-2° 
already result in faulty location and this is significant because the 
edges of the strips are particularly pathogenic. Careful detection 
of all the relationships requires much time and experience, and 
often needs several investigations to cross-check the results. The 
disturbance zones are located with divining rods or radio 
equipment. Just as the radiation pattern is broken vertically at the 
intersection between ground and air (i.e. at the earth's surface), 
Endros has demonstrated with models that these breaks are also 
detectable on the solid floors of multistorey buildings ~ (7). He 
has shown a clear illustration of these breaks caused by an 
underground stream .» (8) and measured the strength of the 
disturbances above a watercourse» (9). 

The main detrimental effect of such pathogenic zones is that 
of ‘devitalisation’: for example, tiredness, disturbances of the 
heart, kidneys, circulation, breathing, stomach and metabolism, 
and could extend as far as serious chronic diseases such as 
cancer. In most cases, moving the bed to a disturbance-free zone 
gives relief within a short space of time » (5). The effect of so- 
called neutralising apparatus is debatable, many of them having 
been discovered to be a source of disturbance. Disturbance does 
not occur, it seems, in rooms proportioned to the golden section 
(e.g. height 3m, width 4m, length 5m) and round houses or 
hexagonal plans (honeycomb) are also praised.

BUILDING BIOLOGY 


Physicists recognise that matter exists in three ‘phases’, depending on 
its temperature and external pressure: (a) solid, (b) liquid and (c) 
gaseous. For example, with water, when under 0°C it exists as a solid 
(a), namely ice; at normal temperature = (b) = water; when over 100° 
= (c) = steam. Other materials change phase at different temperatures. 

The atoms or molecules that make up the material are in constant 
motion. In solid metals, for example, the atoms vibrate around fixed 
points in a crystalline structure -. @). When heated, the movement 
becomes increasingly agitated until the melting point is reached. At this 
temperature, the bonds holding specific atoms together are broken 
down and metal liquefaction occurs, enabling the atoms to move more 
freely + @). Further heating causes more excitation of the atoms until the 
boiling point is reached. Here, the motion is so energetic that the atoms 
can escape all inter-atom forces of attraction and disperse to form the 
gaseous state = @). On the reverse side, all atomic or molecular 
movement stops completely at absolute zero, 0 kelvin (OK = —273.15°)C). 

These transitions in metals are, however, not typical of all 
materials. The atomic or molecular arrangement of each material 
gives it its own properties and dictates how it reacts to and affects its 
surroundings. In the case of glass, for example, although it is 
apparently solid at room temperature, it does not have a crystalline 
structure, the atoms being in a random, amorphous state. It is, 
therefore, technically, a supercooled liquid. The density of vapour 
molecules in air depends on the temperature, so the water molecules 
diffuse to the cooler side (where the density is lower). To replace 
them, air molecules diffuse to the inside, both movements being 
hindered by the diffusion resistance of the wall construction > @. 

Many years of research on building materials by Schroder-Speck 
suggests that organic materials absorb or break up radiation of mineral 
origin. For instance, asphalt matting, with 100mm strip edge overlaps 
all round, placed on concrete floors diverted the previously penetrating 
radiation. The adjacent room, however, received bundled diverted 
rays. > (6) - @. In an alternative experiment, a granulated cork floor 
showed a capacity to absorb the radiation. Cork sheets 25~30mm thick 
(not compressed and sealed), tongued and grooved all round are also 
suitable — (8). 

Clay is regarded as a ‘healthy earth’ and bricks and roofing tiles 
fired at about 950°C give the optimum living conditions. For 
bricklaying, sulphur-free white lime is recommended, produced by 
slaking burnt lime in a slaking pit and where fatty lime is produced 
through maturation. Hydraulic lime should, however, be used in 
walls subject to damp. Lime has well known antiseptic qualities and 
is commonly used as a lime wash in stables and cow sheds. 

Plaster is considered best when it is fired as far below 200°C as 
possible, preferably with a constant humidity similar to animal 
textiles (leather, silk etc.). Sandstone as a natural lime-sandstone is 
acceptable but should not be used for complete walls. 

Timber is light and warm and is the most vital of building 
materials. Timber preservation treatments should be derived from 
the distillation of wood itself (e.g. as wood vinegar, wood oil or 
wood tar). Timber reacts well to odours and it is therefore 
recommended that genuine timber be used for interior cladding, if 
necessary as plywood using natural glues. Ideally, the ‘old rules’ 
should be followed: timber felled only in winter, during the waning 
moon, then watered for one year in a clay pit before it is sawn. 
However, this is very expensive. 

For insulation, natural building materials such as cork granules 
and cork sheets (including those with bitumen coating) are 
recommended, as well as all plant-based matting (e.g. sea grass, 
coconut fibre etc.), together with expanded clay and diatomaceous 
earth (fossil meal). Plastics, mineral fibres, mineral wool, glass fibre, 
aerated concrete, foamed concrete and corrugated aluminium foil 
are not considered to be satisfactory. 

Normal glass for glazing or crystal glass counts as neutral. Better 
still is quartz glass (or bio-glass), which transmits 70-80% of the 
ultra-violet light. Doubts exist about coloured glass. Glazing units 
with glass welded edges are preferable to those with metal or plastic 
sealed edges. One is sceptical about coloured glass. 

Metal is rejected by Palm for exterior walls, as well as for use on 
large areas. This includes copper for roofs on dwellings (but not on 
churches). Generally the advice is to avoid the extensive use of metal. 
Copper is tolerated the best. Iron is rejected (radiators, allegedly, cause 
disturbance in a radius of 4m). Zinc is also tolerated, as is lead. Bronze, 
too, is acceptable (>75% copper) and aluminium is regarded as having 
a future. Asbestos should not be used. With painting it is recommended 
that a careful study is made of the contents and method of manufacture 
of the paint in order to prevent the introduction of damaging radiation. 
Plastics are generally regarded as having no harmful side effects. 
Concrete, particularly reinforced concrete, is rejected in slabs and 
arches but is, however, permitted in foundations and cellars.

BUILDING BIOLOGY 


A differentiation should be made between concrete with clinker 
aggregate and man-made plaster (which have extremely high 
radiation values) and ‘natural’ cement and plaster. Lightweight 
concrete with expanded clay aggregate is tolerable. 

All pipes for water (cold or hot), sewage or gas radiate to 
their surroundings and can influence the organs of living 
creatures as well as plants. Therefore, rooms that are occupied 
by humans and animals for long periods of time (e.g. bedrooms 
and living rooms) should be as far away as possible from 
pipework. Consequently, it is recommended that. all 
installations are concentrated in the centre of the dwelling, in 
the kitchen or bathroom, or collected together in a service wall 
(> p. 277 ©). 

There is a similar problem with electrical wiring carrying 
alternating current. Even if current does not flow, electrical 
fields with pathogenic effects are formed, and when current is 
being drawn, the electromagnetic fields created are reputed to 
be even more harmful. Dr Hartmann found an immediate cure 
in one case of disturbed well-being by getting the patient to pull 
out the plug and therefore eliminate the current in the flex 
which went around the head of his bed — (4). In another case 
similar symptoms were cured by moving a cable running 
between an electric heater and the thermostat from behind the 
head of the double bed to the other side of the room -» @). 
Loose cables are particularly troublesome, as they produce a 
50Hz alternating field syndrome. In addition, electrical 
equipment, such as heaters, washing machines, dish washer, 
boilers and, particularly, microwave ovens with defective seals, 
situated next to or beneath bedrooms send out pathogenic 
radiation through the walls and floors, so that the inhabitants 
are often in an area of several influences > @). Radiation can 
largely be avoided in new buildings by using wiring with 
appropriate insulating sheathing. In existing structures the only 
solution is to re-lay the cables or switch off the current at the 
meter. For this purpose it is now possible to obtain automatic 
shut-off switches when no current is being consumed. In this 
case, a separate circuit is required for appliances that run 
constantly (e.g. freezers, refrigerators, boilers etc.). 

Additionally, harmful radiation covers large areas around 
transformer stations (Schréder-Speck measured radiation from 
a 10-20000V station as far away as 30-50m to the north and 
120-150m to the south), electric railways and high-voltage 
power lines. Even the power earthing of many closely spaced 
houses can give rise to pathogenic effects. 

The human metabolism is influenced by ions (electrically 
charged particles). A person in the open air is subjected to an 
electrical voltage of about 180V, although under very slight 
current due to the lack of a charge carrier. There can be up to 
several thousand ions in one cubic metre of air, depending on 
geographical location and local conditions > @). They vary in 
size and it is the medium and small ions that have a biological 
effect. A strong electrical force field is produced between the 
mostly negatively charged surface of the earth and the 
positively charged air and this affects the body. The research of 
Tschishewskij in the 1920s revealed the beneficial influence of 
negative ions on animals and humans, and showed a 
progressive reduction in the electrical potential of humans with 
increasing age. In addition, the more negative ions there are in 
the air, the slower the rate at which humans age. Research in 
the last 50 years has also confirmed the beneficial effects of 
negative ions in the treatment of high blood pressure, asthma, 
circulation problems and rheumatism. The positive ions are 
predominant in closed rooms, particularly if they are dusty, 
rooms; but only negatively charged oxygenated air is 
biologically valuable. There is a large choice of devices which 
can be placed in work and utility rooms to artificially produce 
the negative ions (i.e. which produce the desirable steady field). 
Such steady fields (continuous current fields) change the 
polarisation of undesirably charged ions to create improved 
room air conditions. The devices are available in the form of 
ceiling electrodes and table or floor mounted units.

town of Schroder-Speck)

THE EYE: PERCEPTION 
Interpretation 


The activity of the eye is divided into seeing and observing. 
Seeing first of all serves our physical safety but observing 
takes over where seeing finishes; it leads to enjoyment of 
the ‘pictures’ registered through seeing. One can 
differentiate between a still and a scanned picture by the 
way that the eye stays on an object or scans along it. The 
still picture is displayed in a segment of the area of a circle, 
whose diameter is the same as the distance of the eye from 
the object. Inside this field of view the objects appear to the 
eye ‘at a glance’ — @). The ideal still picture is displayed in 
balance. Balance is the first characteristic of architectural 
beauty. (Physiologists are working on a theory of the sixth 
sense — the sense of balance or static sense — that underpins 
the sense of beauty we feel with regard to symmetrical, 
harmonious things and proportions (— pp. 27-30) or when 
we are faced with elements that are in balance.) 

Outside this framework, the eye receives its impressions 
by scanning the picture. The scanning eye works forward 
along the obstacles of resistance which it meets as it directs 
itself away from us in width or depth. Obstacles of the same 
or recurring distances are detected by the eye as a ‘beat’ or 
a ‘rhythm’, which has the same appeal as the sounds 
received by the ear from music. ‘Architecture is Frozen 
Music. This effect occurs even when regarding a still or 
scanned picture of an enclosed area > (@) and ©). 

A room whose top demarcation (the ceiling) we 
recognise in the still picture gives a feeling of security, but 
on the other hand in long rooms it gives a feeling of 
depression. With a high ceiling, which the eye can only 
recognise at first by scanning, the room appears free and 
sublime, provided that the distance between the walls, and 
hence the general proportions, are in harmony. Designers 
must be careful with this because the eye is susceptible to 
optical illusions. It estimates the extent of width more 
exactly than depths or heights, the latter always appearing 
larger. Thus a tower seems much higher when seen from 
above rather than from below = p. 24 and (8). Vertical 
edges have the effect of overhanging at the top and 
horizontal ones of curving up in the middle => p. 24 @) - @), 
(9. When taking these things into account, the designer 
should not resort to the other extreme (Baroque) and, for 
example, reinforce the effect of perspective by inclined

determines the size of the details to be differentiated. 

The Greeks complied exactly with this rule. The size of 
the smallest moulding under the cornice of the individual 
temples of varying height is so dimensioned that, at an 
angular distance of 27° > @, it complies with the reading 
field of 0°1'. From this also results the reading distances for 
books (which varies with the size of the letters) and the 
seating plans for auditoriums etc.

MAN AND COLOUR 


Colours have a power over humans. They can create 
feelings of well-being, unease, activity or passivity, for 
instance. Colouring in factories, offices or schools can 
enhance or reduce performance; in hospitals it can have a 
positive influence on patients’ health. This influence works 
indirectly through making rooms appear wider or narrower, 
thereby giving an impression of space, which promotes a 
feeling of restriction or freedom = ©) - @. It also works 
directly through the physical reactions or impulses evoked 
by the individual colours > @) and @). The strongest impulse 
effect comes from orange; then follow yellow, red, green, 
and purple. The weakest impulse effect comes from blue, 
greeny blue and violet (i.e. cold and passive colours). 

Strong impulse colours are suitable only for small areas 
in a room. Conversely, low impulse colours can be used for 
large areas. Warm colours have an active and stimulating 
effect, which in certain circumstances can be exciting. Cold 
colours have a passive effect — calming and spiritual. Green 
Causes nervous tension. The effects produced by colour 
also depend on brightness and location. 

Warm and bright colours viewed overhead have a 
spiritually stimulating effect; viewed from the side, a 
warming, drawing closer effect; and, seen below, a 
lightening, elevating effect. 

Warm and dark colours viewed above are enclosing or 
dignified; seen from the side, embracing; and, seen below, 
suggest safe to grip and to tread on. 

Cold and bright colours above brighten things up and 
are relaxing; from the side they seem to lead away; and, 
seen below, look smooth and stimulating for walking on. 

Cold and dark colours are threatening when above; cold 
and sad from the side; and burdensome, dragging down, 
when below. 

White is the colour of total purity, cleanliness and order. 
White plays a leading role in the colour design of rooms, 
breaking up and neutralising other groups of colours, and 
thereby create an invigorating brightness. As the colour of 
order, white is used as the characteristic surface for 
warehouses and storage places, for road lines and traffic 


markings -> @).

DIMENSIONAL RELATIONSHIPS 


Basis 


There have been agreements on the dimensioning of 
buildings since early times. Essential specific data 
Originated in the time of Pythagoras. He started from the 
basis that the numerical proportions found in acoustics 
must also be optically harmonious. From this, Pythagoras 
developed his right-angled triangle > (1). It contains all the 
harmonious interval proportions, but excludes both the 
disharmonious intervals (i.e. the second and seventh). 

Space measurements are supposed to have been 
derived from these numerical proportions. Pythagoras or 
diophantine equations resulted in groups of numerals >» (@) 
— @ that should be used for the width, height and length of 
rooms. These groups can be calculated using the formula 
a2 + b2 = c?. 

a2 + b2 = c? 

a= m(y2 — x2) 

b=me2*xey 

c= m(y2 + x2) 


In this x and y are all whole numbers, x is smaller than y, 
and m is the magnification or reduction factor. 

The geometric shapes named by Plato and Vitruvius are 
also of critical importance (i.e. circle, triangle — 6) and square 
+ © from which polygonal traverses can be constructed). 
The respective bisection then results in further polygonal 
traverses. Other polygonal traverses (e.g. heptagon — (9), 
nonagon — (0) can only be formed by approximation or by 
superimposition. So we can construct a fifteen-sided figure 
Ee by superimposing the equilateral triangle on the 
pentagon. 

The pentagon or pentagram has a natural relationship 
with the golden section, just like the decagon which is 
derived from it 4%, 42 and —  p. 30. However, in earlier times 
its particular dimensional relationships found hardly any 
application. Polygonal traverses are necessary for the 
design and construction of so-called ‘round’ structures. The

DIMENSIONAL RELATIONSHIPS 
Basis 


A right-angled isosceles (i.e. having two 
equal sides) triangle with a base-to-height 
ratio of 1:2 is the triangle of quadrature. 

An isosceles triangle with a base and 

sides that can be contained by a square was 
yy successfully used by Knauth, the master of 
cathedral construction, for the determination 
Yn of the dimensional relationships for the 
Strasbourg Cathedral. 

Drach’s n/4 triangle > @) is somewhat 
more pointed than the previous one described, as its height 
is determined by the point of a slewed square. It, too, was 
successfully used for details and components. 

Apart from these figures, the dimensional proportions of 
the octagon can be detected on a whole range of old 
structures. The so-called diagonal triangle serves as a basis 
here. The triangle’s height is the diagonal of the square built 
on half the base = @) - @. 

The sides of the rectangle depicted in (5) have a ratio of 
1:V2. In accordance with this, all halvings or doublings of 
the rectangle have the same ratio of 1: V2. The ‘step ladders’ 
within an octagon make available the geometric ranges In 
(2) - @. The steps of square roots from 1-7 are shown in 6). 
The connection between square roots of whole numbers is 
shown in (. 

The process of factoring makes possible the application 
of square roots for building in non-rectangular components. 
By building up approximated values for square figures, 
Mengeringhausen developed the MERO space frames. The 
principle is the so-called ‘snail’ > @) — (0. The inaccuracies 
of the right angle are compensated for by the screw 
connections of the rods at the joints. A subtly differentiated 
approximated calculation of square roots of whole numbers 
Vn for non-rectangular components is available from the 
use of continued fractions (> p. 30) in the formula

DIMENSIONAL RELATIONSHIPS 
Application 


The application of geometrical and dimensional relationships on 
the basis of the details given earlier was described by Vitruvius. 
According to his investigations, the Roman theatre, for example, 
is built on the triangle turned four times —~ (1) the Greek theatre 
on a square turned three times > @). Both designs result in a 
dodecagon. This is recognisable on the stairs. Moessel has tried 
to detect the use of proportional relationships in accordance with 
the golden section > @), although this is not obvious. The only 
Greek theatre whose plan view is based on a pentagon stands in 
Epidaurus > (4). 

In a housing estate recently uncovered in Antica-Ostia, the old 
harbour of Rome, the golden section is recognised as being the 
design principle. This principle consists of a bisection of the 
diagonal of a square. If the points at which the arc of the circle cuts 
the sides of the square are joined with \2/2, a nine-part grid is 
obtained. The square in the middle is called the square of the Holy 
Section. The arc AB has up to a 0.6% deviation and the same 
length as the diagonal CD of the base square. Thus the Holy 
Section shows an approximate method for squaring the circle — 
(5) — ©. The whole building complex, from site plan to the general 
arrangement details, is built with these dimensional proportions. 

In his four books on architecture, Palladio gives a 
geometrical key, which is based on the details given by 
Pythagoras. He uses the same space relationships (circle, 
triangle, square, etc.) and harmonies for his structures ( > (9) 
and (10). 

Such laws of proportion can be found formulated in 
absolutely clear rules by the cultures of the ancient peoples of 
the Far East > (1). The Indians with their ‘Manasara’, the 
Chinese with their modulation in accordance with the ‘Toukou’ 
and, particularly, the Japanese with their ‘Kiwariho’ method 


have created structural systematics, which guarantee 
traditional development and offer immense economic 
advantages. 


In the 18th century and later, it was not a harmonic but an 
additive arrangement of dimensions which was preferred > (2. 
The Octameter system developed from this. It was only with the 
introduction of the modular ordering system that the 
understanding of harmonic and proportional dimensional 
relationships returned > (3) and (14). Details of the coordination 
system and coordination dimensions are given on pp. 34-5.

Explanation of the values and sets of the Le Modulor according 
to Le Corbusier 





DIMENSIONAL RELATIONSHIPS 
Application of Le Modulor 


The architect Le Corbusier developed a theory of 
Proportion, which is based on the golden section and the 
dimensions of the human body. The golden section of a 
segment of a line can be determined either geometrically or 
by formulae. It means that a line segment can be divided so 
that the whole of the line segment can be related to a bigger 
dividing segment, just as the larger is to the smaller _» 4). 
That is: _1__ major 
major minor 

and shows the connection of proportional relationships 
between the square, the circle and the triangle > ©. 

The golden section of a line segment can also be 
determined by a continued fraction 


Gat: 
G 


This is the simplest unending regular continued fraction. Le 
Corbusier marked out three intervals in the human body, 
which form a known golden section series according to 
Fibonacci. These are between the foot, the solar plexus, the 
head, the finger of the raised hand. First of all Le Corbusier 
Started out from the known average height for Europeans 
(1.75m > pp. 16-17), which he divided up In accordance 
with the golden section into 108.2 — 66.8 — 41.45 -25.4cm , 
4). 

As this last dimension was almost exactly equal to 10 
inches, he found in this way a connection with the English 
inch, although not for the larger dimensions. For this 
reason, Le Corbusier changed over in 1947 to 6 English feet 
(1.828m) as the height of the body. By golden section 
division he built the red row up and down _; (5). As the steps 
in this row are much too big for practical use, he also built 
up a blue row, starting from 2.26 m (i.e. the finger tips of the 
raised hand), which gave double the values expressed in 
the red row — 6). The values of the red and blue rows were 
converted by Le Corbusier into dimensions which were 
practically applicable.

The limitless values of figures 


For any construction project, completed standard description 
forms give the most valuable and clearest information, and are 
ideal for estimating, for the construction supervisor and as a 
permanent reference in the site office. Any time-consuming 
queries based on false information are virtually eliminated; the 
time gained more than compensating the effort involved in 
completing the record book. At the top of the form, there are 
columns for entering relevant room dimensions, in a way easily 
referred to. The inputs are most simply made using key words. 
The column ‘size’ should be used merely for entry of the 
necessary dimensions of the items, e.g., the height of the 
skirting board or the frieze, the width of the window sill, etc. 
Finally, several spaces are provided for special components. A 
space should be left free under each heading, so that the form 
can easily be extended for special cases. The reverse side of the 
form is best left free so that drawings may be added to 
elaborate on the room description on the next sheet. The A4 
format pages are duplicated, each position containing exactly 
the same text; the sheets are kept up to date and eventually 
bound together. At the conclusion of the building work, the 
record book is the basis for the settlement of claims, using the 
dimensions at the head of the room pages. Later, the record 
book provides an objective record of progress, and is available 
for those with specialist knowledge. 


Standard Numbering System 

Metric units of linear measurement were first defined in France 
in 1790, although official recognition did not take place until 
1840. The metre was established as the new decimal unit of 
length on a scientific basis, defined as the length of a simple 
pendulum having a swing of one second at sea level on latitude 
45°. A standard numbering system was devised in Germany, 
shortly after World War |, to achieve uniformity and 
standardisation in the measurement of machines and technical 
equipment — a system also used in France and the USA. The 
starting point for measurement is the Continental unit of 
measurement: the metre. In the Imperial system (used in the 
UK, USA and elsewhere), 40 inches = 1.016m = 1.00m. 

The requirement of building technology for geometrical 
subdivisions precluded the use of the purely decimal 
subdivision of the metre, so the Standard Numbering System, 
based on the structure of 2s, was introduced into the decimal 
structure: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31.5, 63, 125, 250, 500, 1000 — @). (The 
coarser 5-part division and the finer 20- and 40-part division 
series are inserted appropriately with their intermediate 
values.) The geometrical 10-part division of the standard 
number series was formed from the halving series (1000, 500, 
250, 125, ...) and from the doubling series (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...). 
Because n = 3.14 and \10 = 3.16, the number 32, following 16 in 
the series, was rounded down to 31.5. Similarly, in the halving 
sequence, 62.5 was rounded up to 63. 

Standard numbers offer many advantages in calculations: 

1 the product and quotient of any two standard numbers are 
standard numbers 

2 integer powers of standard numbers are standard numbers, 
and 

3 double (or half) a standard number is a standard number. 


Building measurements 

In contrast to engineering, in building construction, there is little 
requirement for a geometric division as opposed to the 
prevailing arithmetic addition of identical structural components 
(e.g. blocks, beams, joists, girders, columns and windows). 
Routine measurements for standard components must, 
therefore, comply with these requirements. However, they 
should also conform to concepts of technical standardisation 
and the standard numbering system. A standard system of 
measurement for building construction was based on the 
standard numbering system, and this is the basis for many 
further building standards and of measurement for design and 
construction, particularly in building construction above ground.

Standard measurements 

The controlling dimensions are dimensions between key 
reference planes (e.g. floor-to-floor height); they provide not 
only a framework for design but also a basis which components 
and assemblies may refer to > (). 

Standard dimensions are theoretical but, in practice, they 
provide the basis for individual, basic structural and finished 
measurements; thus all building components are linked in an 
organised way (e.g. standard building brick length = 250mm 
(225mm in UK), in situ concrete wall thickness = 250mm.)

BASIC MEASUREMENTS 


Individual (mostly small) dimensions are used for details of 
basic construction/ finishing (e.g., thickness of joints/ plaster, 
dimensions of rebates, wall fixings/tolerances). Basic 
structural measurements relate, for example, to masonry 
(excluding plaster thicknesses), structural floor thicknesses, 
unplastered doors and window openings. Finished 
measurements refer to the finished building (e.g. net 
measurements of surface finished rooms and openings, net 
areas and finished floor levels). For building construction 
without joints, nominal dimensions equal the standard 
dimensions; with joints, the allowance for the joint is 
subtracted: e.g. building brick nominal length = standard 
length (250mm) —- thickness of intermediate joint (10mm) = 
240mm; nominal thickness of in-situ concrete walls = 
standard thickness = 250mm. In accordance with the 
standard number and measurement systems, small 
dimensions (<25mm), are chosen (in mm) as: 25, 20, 16,12.5, 
10, 8, 6.3, 5, 3.2, 2.5, 2, 1.6, 1.25, 1. In many European 
countries, even small structural components conform with 
the standard building numbering system, e.g. standardised 
building bricks. A nominal brick dimension of 240x115mm 
reconciles the old non-metric format (250x120mm or 
260x130mm_ with joints) with the new standard 
(250x 125mm with joints). With the appropriate height, with 
joint, of 62.5mm (nominal brick dimension = 52mm), this 
gives an aspect ratio of 250x125x62.5 — 4:2:1. . @ 

Other basic construction component dimensions (e.g. 
concrete blocks > p. 63, window and door openings » p. 
176-87 and floor levels) are similarly aligned, so these 
numerical values reoccur. The UK brickwork dimensions

Japan has the oldest building size regulations where, 
following the great fire in Tokyo in 1657, the style and size 
of houses were laid down on the basis of systematic 
measurement according to the ‘Kiwariho method’. The 
basic dimension was the Ken = 6 Japanese feet = 1.818m. 
The distances between the wall axes were measured in half 
or whole Ken, windows doors and even mat sizes were 
determined on this basis, which considerably simplified 
house building in Japan, making it quicker and cheaper. 
Examples ~> BOL. 

In Germany, a similar system was developed in the area 
of half-timbered construction, prior to the introduction of 
the metre. The determining unit was the Prussian foot, 
which was most widely propagated and corresponded to 
the Rhenish and Danish foot. 

The dimension between the axes of uprights was mostly 
1 Gefach = 2 Ellen = 4 feet — @). The Prussian, Rhenish and 
Danish foot, still in use in building practice in Denmark, is 
translated as 312.5mm, the Elle as 625mm and the Gefach 
as 1.25m, in the metric system. Private construction firms 
had adopted a similar system of 1.25m, for their system 
buildings, particularly for wood panel construction. 

The UK and USA adopted a system of measurement 
based on 4 feet, which is close to 1.25m, with 4 English feet 
= 1.219m. Building panels (e.g. hardboard) manufactured 
on US machines are therefore 1.25m wide in countries 
using the metric system. German pumice boards for roofs 
also have the standard dimension of 2 x 1.25 = 2.50m, the 
same as plaster boards. Finally, 125 is the preferred number 
in the standard number system. The series. of 
measurements resulting from 1.25m was standardised in 
Germany in 1942 with the corresponding roof slopes > ©). 
In the meantime, thousands of types of structural 
components have been produced to this system of 
measurement. The distance between the axes of beams in 
finished ceilings today is, accordingly, usually 125/2 = 
625mm = the length of the stride of a human adult = p. 17. 


Unified distances between axes for factory and 
industrial premises and accommodation 
Industrial structures and structures for accommodation are 
mostly subdivided in plan into a series of axes at right 
angles. The line of measurement for these axes is always 
the axis of the structural system of the construction. The 
separations between axes are dimensional components of 
the plan, which determine the position of columns, 
supports, the centres of walls, etc. In the case of rigid 
frames, the centre axes of the bearing points of the 
foundations are decisive. The measurements are always 
referenced to the horizontal plan and vertical projection 
plane, even in the case of sloping roofs. 

In industrial structures, a basic measurement of 2.5m 
applies to the spacing of axes. Multiples of this give axis 
spacing of 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0m, etc. In special cases

BASIC MEASUREMENTS 


(accommodation or slab structures), a basic measurement 
of 2.50/2 = 1.25m, or a multiple thereof, can be used. This 
results in intermediate dimensions of 1.25, 3.75, 6.25, 
8.75m. However, so far as possible, these sub-dimensions 
should not be used above 10m. 

Appropriate geometric steps over 10m are recommended 
as follows: 12.50m, 15.00m, 20.00m, 25.00m, 30.00m, 
40.00m, 50.00m, 60.00m, (62.50m), 80.00m, 100.00 m. 

Roof slopes depend on the type of roofing and the sub- 
construction employed. The following roof slopes have been 
established to correspond with practical requirements: 

1:20 for boarded roofing on steel and reinforced 
concrete structures and wood cement roofs, with 
the exception of special designs such as shell and 
saw-tooth roofs, etc. 

1:12.5 for boarded roofing on wooden structures 

1:4 for corrugated cement roofing, ridged zinc 
roofing, corrugated sheet roofing, steel roofs on 
lattice work or casings, ribbed steel roofs of 
galvanised, double folded sheet and roofing in 
waterproof paper-based materials for 
accommodation premises 

eZ for flat roofs, etc. 

The systematic unification of industrial and 
accommodation structures has been a gradual process of 
type development. 

The cited axis spacings influence the individual 
structural components: columns, walls, ceilings, trusses, 
purlins, rafters, roof planking, windows, glazing, doors, 
gates, crane runways and other elements. The 
establishment of a specified basic measurement for the 
spacing of axes creates the prerequisites for a hierarchical 
system of measurement standardisation for individual 
structural components and their matching interconnection. 
The spacings between axes are simply added together, 
without intermediate measurements. However, masonry, 
glass panes, reinforced concrete panels etc., must include 
an element for the jointing arrangements. 

The points of support for a travelling crane can be 
unified on the basis of the standardised axis spacings. 

The matched, standardised components and assemblies 
are interchangeable, can be prepared off-site and used in a 
versatile manner. Mass production, interchangeability of 
components/assemblies and the availability of standardised 
components and assemblies in store result in savings in 
work, materials, costs and time. The arrangement of the 
structural axes brings considerable simplification to 
building supervision.

MODULAR SYSTEM 


International agreements on the planning and execution of 
building work and for the design and manufacture of 
building components and semi-finished products are 
incorporated into national standards. The modular system 
is a means of coordinating the dimensions applicable to 
building work. 

The term ‘coordination’ is the key, indicating that the 
modular layout involves an arrangement of dimensions and 
the spatial coordination of structural components. Therefore, 
the standards deal with geometrical and dimensional 
requirements. The modular system develops a method of 
design and construction which uses a coordinate system as a 
means of planning and executing building projects. A 
coordinate system is always related to specific objects. 


Geometric considerations 

By means of the system of coordinates, buildings and 
components are arranged and their exact positions and 
sizes specified. The nominal dimensions of components as 
well as the dimensions of joints and interconnections can 
thereby be derived. -— d@)- ©), (3) 

A coordinate system consists of planes at right angles to 
each other, spaced according to the coordinate 
measurements. Depending on the system, the planes can 
be different in size and in all three dimensions. 

As a rule, components are arranged in one dimension 
between parallel coordinate planes so that they fill up the 
coordinate dimension, including the allowance allocated to 
the joints and also taking the tolerances into account. Hence 
a component can be specified in one dimension in terms of 
its size and position. This is referred to as boundary 
reference. > (7) > 42 

In other cases, it can be advantageous not to arrange a 
component between two planes, but rather to make the 
central axis coincide with one plane of the coordinate system. 
The component is initially specified in one dimension with 
reference to its axis, but in terms of position only. -»@ + a2 

A coordinate system can be divided into sub-systems for 
different component groups, e.g. load-bearing structure, 
component demarcating space, etc. > 

It has been established that individual components need 
not be modularised, e.g. individual steps on stairways, 
windows, doors, etc. > 

For non-modular components which run along or across 
the whole building, a so-called ‘non-modular’ zone can be 
introduced, which divides the coordinate system into two- 
sub systems. The assumption is that the dimension of the 
component in the non-modular zone is already known at 
the time of setting out the coordinate system, since the non- 


modular zone can only have completely specified 
dimensions. > Q) 
Further possible arrangements of non-modular 


components are the so-called centre position and edge 
position within modular zones. — 40) — 41)

BUILDING DETAILS 
Functional Use of Materials 


In the earliest civilisations, building form was dictated by 
the techniques of binding, knotting, tying, plaiting and 
weaving. Building in timber followed later, and in nearly all 
civilisations became the basis for architectural form (see the 
example of the Greek temple > (1) and @). 

Recognition of this is relatively recent, but there is an 
increasing number of examples which support the accuracy 
of this theory. Uhde researched this matter at length and 
established that Moorish architectural skills originate from 
timber construction, in particular the Alhambra at Granada. 
The internal surface decor of Moorish buildings has its 
source in weaving techniques (like the ribbons and beaded 
astragals on Greek buildings), although it was actually 
pressed into the gypsum by moulds or inlaid as ‘Azujelos’ 
(glazed strips of clay). In several rooms of the Alcazar in 
Seville one can clearly see in the corners of the rooms the 
knotting together of the walls in the gypsum finish exactly 
in the way that the wall carpets of the tents were knotted at 
the corners in earlier centuries. Here the form derived from 
tent construction was simply transferred to the gypsum 
mould. 

Under the same conditions, forms which result from the 
material, construction and functional requirements are 
similar or even identical in every country and time. 

The ‘eternal form’ was traced by V. Wersin with 
convincing examples. He showed that utensils used in the 
Far East and in Europe in 3000 Bc are strikingly similar to 
those in use today. With new material, new technology and 
changing use, a different form inevitably evolves, even 
though embellishments can obscure or conceal the true 
form, or even give the impression of something quite 
different (baroque). The spirit of the age tends to decide the 
form of the building. 

Today, in the buildings of other periods, we study not so 
much the result as the origin of the art. Each style arrives at 
its ‘eternal form’, its true culmination, after which it is 
developed and refined. We still strive after a true expression 
with our use of concrete, steel and glass. We have achieved 
success in finding some new and convincing solutions for 
factories and monumental buildings, in which the need for 
extensive window areas determines and expresses the 
structure. 

The plain and distinct representation of the building 
parts, in conformity with their technical functions, provides 
possibilities for new forms in the details and the outward 
expression of buildings. Herein lies the new challenge for 
architects today. It is wrong to believe that our age needs 
only to develop clean technological solutions and leave it to 
the next period to cultivate a new form emanating from 
these structures = @). On the contrary, every architect has 
the duty to harness contemporary technical possibilities 
extensively and to exploit their artistic potential to create 
buildings that express the ethos of the modern world (> p. 
39). This requires tact, restraint, respect for the 
Surroundings, organic unity of building, space and 
construction, and a harmonious relationship between the 
articulation of interior spaces and the exterior form, in 
addition to fulfilling technological, organisational and 
economic demands. Even major artists with true creative 
drive (‘those who have something to say’) are subject to 
these restrictions and are influenced by the spirit of the age. 

The clearer the artistic vision or the view of life of the 
artist, the more mature and rich the content of his work, and 
the longer it will endure as a beautiful object of true art for 
all time.

The house of the 2000s will have slender steel supports and 
slim non-load-bearing curtain walling, the composition of which 
affords full protection against the weather, and maximum noise 
and heat insulation. Open plan, with dividing screens between 
living area, dining room and hall (no doors) 


way of life — open to nature and yet in every respect 
protected against its inclemency. 

People generally see and feel things differently. 
Designers must therefore use their creativity as far as 
possible to translate our shared experience into reality and 
express it through the materials at their disposal. The 
attitude of the client is of the greatest significance in this 
issue. In some ways, many clients and architects are still 
living in the 15th century while few of each have arrived in 
the new millennium. If the ‘centuries’ meet in the right way, 
then a happy marriage between client and architect is 
assured.

Building programme 

The work begins with the drawing-up of a detailed brief, 

with the help of an experienced architect and guided by the 

questionnaire shown on the following pages. Before 
planning starts, the following must be known: 

1 Site: location, size, site and access levels, location of 
services, building and planning regulations and 
conditions. This information should be sought from the 
local authority, service providers and legal 
representatives, and a layout plan to comply with this 
should be developed. 

2 Space requirements with regard to areas, heights, 
positioning and their particular relationship with one 
another. 

3 Dimensions of existing furniture. 

4 Finance: site acquisition, legal fees, mortgages etc. > pp. 
43-50. 

5 Proposed method of construction

(brick, frame 





DESIGN METHOD 
Working Process 


The sketch scheme is begun by drawing up individual 
rooms of the required areas as simple rectangles drawn to 
scale and put provisionally into groups. After studying the 
movements of the people and goods (horizontally and 
vertically), analyse circulation and the relationships of 
rooms to each other and the sun » p. 272. During this stage 
the designer will progressively obtain a clearer 
understanding of the design problems involved. Instead of 
starting to design at this stage they should, on the basis of 
their previous work to establish the building area, 
determine the position of the building on the site, by 
exploring the various means of access, the prevailing wind, 
tree growth, contours, aspect, and neighbourhood. Try out 
several solutions to explore all possibilities . @ and use 
their pros and cons for a searching examination — unless of 
course a single obvious solution presents itself. Based on 
the foregoing, decision-making is normally fairly quick, and 
the ‘idea’ becomes clearer; then the real picture of the 
building emerges > ©). 

Now the first design stage can begin, firstly as an 
Organisational and spiritual impression in the mind. From 
this, a schematic representation of the general 
configuration of the building and its spatial atmosphere is 
built up, from which the designer can develop the real 
proposal, in the form of plans and elevations. Depending 
upon temperament and drawing ability a quick charcoal 
sketch, or a spidery doodle, forms the first tangible result of 
this ‘birth’. 

The first impetus may become lost if the efforts of 
assistants are clumsy. With growing experience and 
maturity, the clarity of the mental image improves, allowing 
it to be communicated more easily. Older, mature architects 
are often able to draw up a final design in freehand, 
correctly dimensioned and detailed. Some refined mature 
works are created this way, but the verve of their earlier 
work ts often lacking. 

After completion of the preliminary design, > (3), a pause 
of 3-14 days is recommended, because it provides a 
distancing from the design and lets shortcomings reveal 
themselves more clearly. It also often disposes of 
assumptions, because in the intervening time preconceived 
ideas are put aside, not least as a result of discussions with 
staff and clients. Then the detailed design of the project is 
begun with the assistance of various consultants (e.g. a 
structural engineer, service engineers for heating, water 
and electricity) firmly establishing the construction and 
installations. 

Following this, but usually before, the plans are 
submitted to the relevant authorities for examination and 
permission (which might take about 3-6 months). During 
this time the costs are estimated and specification and Bill 
of Quantities produced, and the tendering procedure is 
undertaken, so that as soon as the permission to proceed is 
received, contracts can be granted and the work on site 
commenced. 

All these activities, from receiving the commission to the 
start of building operations for a medium-sized family 
house, takes on average 2-3 months of the architect's time: 
for larger projects (hospitals, etc.) 6-12 months should be 
allowed. It is not advisable to try to make savings at this 
juncture; the extra time spent is soon recovered during 
building operations if the preparation has been thoroughly 
carried out. The client thus saves money and mortgage 
interest payments. The questionnaire (-. pp. 41 and 42) and 
the room specification folder (+ p. 31) will be important 
aids. 


BUILDING DESIGN 


Preparatory Work: Collaboration with Client 


Preparatory work is often done in a rush, resulting in an insufficiently detailed scheme being put out to tender and 
commenced on site. This is how ‘final’ drawings and costs only become available when the building is nearly complete. 
Explanations are of no help to the client. The only way of solving the problem is faster and better organised work by the 
architect and sufficient preparation in the design office and on the construction site. 

Similar information is required for most building projects, so detailed questionnaires and pro formas, available when the 
commission is received, can be used to speed things up. Certainly there will be some variations, but many factors are 
common and make questionnaires useful to all those involved in the project, even if they are only used as checklists. 


The following questionnaire is only one of the labour saving pro formas which an efficient and well-run architect's office 


should have available, along with pro formas for costing purposes, etc.

A Definition of terms 

Definition of duties describing the necessary architectural 
services and the relevant fees are contained in the 
respective guidelines for each country or professional body, 
e.g. the RIBA Architects’ Plan of Work in the UK, or the HOAI 
[Honorarordnung fur Architekten und Ingenieure] in 
Germany. 


1.0 Building design 

The briefing and design stages (A-D in RIBA Plan of Work, 
1-4 in HOAI) include inception/feasibility (3%), outline 
proposals (7%), scheme design (11%) and approvals 
planning (6%). Design services typically represent 27% of 
the total fee. 


2.0 Building construction 

The production drawings and information stages (E-H in 
RIBA Plan of Work, 5-9 in HOAI) include detail design, 
production information, bill of quantities (if applicable) 
(25%), preparing tender documents (10%), tender action 
(4%), site supervision (31%), project administration and 
documentation (3%). Construction management duties 
typically represent 73% of the total fee. 


B Duties and outputs for construction management 
1.0 Construction planning 


1.1 Definition of duties and outputs/contents 

Basic services 

* Working through the results of stages 2 and 4 (stage 
by stage processing information and presenting 
solutions) - taking into account the urban context, 
design parameters, and _ functional, technical, 
structural, economic, energy (e.g. rational energy use) 
biological, and economical requirements — and co- 
operating with other building professionals, to bring 
the design to the stage where it can be constructed 

* Presenting the design in a full set of drawings with all 
the necessary documentation including detail and 
construction drawings, 1:50 to 1:1, and accompanying 
specifications in text 


CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT 


* In schemes which include interior fittings and design, 
preparing detailed drawings of the rooms and fittings 
to scales 1:25 to 1:1, together with the necessary 
specifications of materials and workmanship 

* Coordination of the input of the other members of the 
design team and integrating their information to 
produce a viable solution 

* Preparation and co-ordination of the production 
drawings during the building stage 

Additional services 

These additional services can be included as basic services 
if they are specifically listed in a schedule of services. This 
will negate some of the limitations in the standard list of 
basic services. 

* Setting up a detailed area-by-area specification in the 
form of a room schedule to serve as a basis for a 
description of materials, areas and volumes, duties 
and programme of works 

* Setting up a detailed specification in the form of a bill 
of quantities to serve as a basis for a description of 
materials, duties and programme of works 

* Inspection of the contractors’ and sub-contractors’ 
specialist design input developed on the basis of the 
specification and programme of works, to check that 
it accords with the overall design planning 

* Production of scale models of details and prototypes 
Inspection and approval of design drawings produced 
by organisations outside the design team, testing that 
they accord with the overall design planning (e.g., 
fabrication drawings from specialist manufacturers and 
contractors, setting-up and foundation drawings from 
machine manufacturers), insomuch as their contracts 
do not form a part of the main contract sum (upon 
which the professional fees have been calculated) 


1.2 Aims/risks of construction planning 

Construction planning aims to ensure a trouble- and fault- 
free execution of the works. This requires a complete and 
detailed establishment of the formal and technical 
requirements, and their compliance with formal, legal, 
technical and economic matters. 

* Legal basis: planning and building regulations, and 
other regulations such as safety guidelines, e.g. for 
places of assembly 

* Technical basis: established standards and techniques 
of construction and materials, e.g. building standards, 
consultation/agreement with specialists and specialist 
contractors 

* Economic basis: cost control techniques, e.g. cost 
estimates/calculations, and consultation/agreement 
with specialists in this field 

Insufficient construction planning results in - among other 
things - wastage of materials (correction of errors, 
breakages and decay), waste of productive time (time 
wasting, duplicated work),and persistent loss of value 
(planning mistakes/construction faults). 


1.3 Means and tools for construction management 
Construction drawings contain all the necessary 
information and dimensions for construction purposes; 
normal scale is 1:50. 

Sectional drawings (component drawings, junction 
drawings), expand on the construction drawings with 
additional information on parts of the building works; 
normal scale is 1:20, 1:10, 1:5 or 1:1. 

Special drawings are tailored to the specific 
requirements of elements of the work (e.g. reinforced 
concrete work, steelwork or timber structural work) and 
show only the essential aspects of the other building 
features which relate to that particular specific element of 
work; normal scale is 1:50, depending on the particular 
needs. National standards and conventions govern the 





43 





44 





drawing modes which, ideally, should be compatible with 
CAD (computer aided design) and the standard methods of 
specification and measurement of quantities and pricing. 
Suitable software packages are available. 

Area/room/component schedules, specifications, bills of 
quantities, contain full information — in the form of lists and 
tables — about the sizes (e.g. length, width, height, area and 
volume), the materials (e.g. wall coverings and floor 
finishes), and equipment (e.g. heating, ventilation, sanitary, 
electrics, windows and doors) of which make up the 
building, building elements, rooms or other areas. They 
serve as a basis for a full specification of materials and 
workmanship. Bills of quantities are commonly used in the 
UK and for large contracts in other countries. 


2.0 Tender action and letting of contracts i.e. the 
preparation/co-operation during tender action and letting of 
contracts 


2.1 Definition of duties and outputs/contents i.e. stages G+ H 
in RIBA Plan of Work, and 6 + 7 in HOAI 
Basic services

schedules 


2.2 Aims/risks of tender action and letting of contracts 
The tender action aims to formulate contract documents 
which will enable the construction work of a project to be 
carried out within the civil legal framework, thus affording 
the relevant structure of regulation and guarantees. Tenders 
can be sought when all the relevant information is available 
for costing. Tender documents consist of: schedule of 
conditions (e.g. specifications and contractual obligations) 
plus clauses with descriptions (e.g. possibilities for 
inspecting the details of the conditions / location, date of the 
project Commencement and completion / limits to time and 
additional costs). 

Tender documents that include the price of the work and 
signature of the contractor (or his rightful representative) 
become an offer, which can be negotiated or accepted 
unchanged, resulting in the formulation of a contract, 
governing everything necessary for the carrying out of the 


CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT 


works (e.g. type and extent of the work, amount and 
manner of payment, timetable and deadlines, and 
responsibilities). 

To prevent, from the outset, differences. of 
understanding and opinion between the members of the 
contract — and to make clear their mutual responsibilities — 
contract documents (and hence also the tender documents) 
must be comprehensive and complete. 

Unclear, incomplete tender documents lead to poor 
building contracts, which provoke conflict, time overruns, 
defects, loss of value and additional costs. 


2.3 Means and tools of tender action and letting of contracts 
Contract laws and regulations depend on the country and 
local situation, and regulate, through the building contract, 
the legal relationship between the client and the contractor. 
They generally determine what constitutes a valid contract, 
how long the liabilities of the contract are valid, recourse to 
damages, dispute settlement, professional responsibilities 
and liabilities, and other aspects with regard to contractual 
relationships. 

Contract conditions and articles of agreement are 
specific to the particular form of contract being used. 
Because there are many types of standard contract 
document, it is important that a suitable contract type is 
chosen to meet the needs of the particular project. Typical 
headings of clauses of a contract for larger works are listed 
here: 

* Identification of the different members mentioned in 

the contract, and a description of their role and duties, 

e.g. employer, contractor, sub-contractors or architect 
* Interpretation, definitions, etc. 

Contractor's obligations 

The contract sum, additions or deductions, 

adjustments and interim certificates for partial 

completion of work 

* Architect’s instructions, form and_ timing of 

instructions during the contract 
* Contract and other documents, and issues of 
certificates for completions 
Statutory obligations, notices, fees and charges

Technical conditions and preambles relate directly to the 
work to be undertaken and are formulated as general 
specifications, schedules of duties, general quality of 
workmanship, programmes of work, etc. and are often 
divided into the various trades. Typical headings under this 
section are listed below: 

* Scope of work and supply of goods, e.g. includes 
provision of all necessary tools, purchase, delivery, 
unloading, storage and installation of all goods 

* Quality of goods and components, national or 
international standards which must be adhered to 

* Quality of workmanship, national or international 
standards of workmanship which must be achieved 

* Additional and special duties, specification of the 
types and range of additional works included within 
the price, and those special duties which are to be 
charged in addition 

* Method of calculating the amount to be paid to the 
contractor, and determination of the means of 
measurement of the work done, e.g. quantitative 
units, boundaries between different sections of work, 
measuring techniques, and types of pay calculations 
(on a time basis, piece work, fixed rates, fluctuating 
rates, etc.) 

* Preambles, more specific and general items of 
agreement not covered in detail in the main contract 
conditions can be classed under three headings: 
necessary items are prescriptive (e.g. methods of 
handover), recommended items are advisory (e.g. 
sequence of work and programming) and possible 
items are suggested (e.g. feedback protocols, 
meetings, etc.) — taking care that there is no conflict 
between the preambles and the main contract 

Specifications, manufacturers’ specifications, performance 
specifications are detailed descriptions for every part of the 
work which needs to be carried out. The extent and 
sophistication of these specifications vary, depending on 
the size and complexity of the project: for small, simple 
projects, drawings and specifications will suffice; larger 
projects need, in addition, schedules (e.g. door and window 
ironmongery) and bills of quantities (listing the extent of the 
various elements of the work and giving a basis for the 
pricing of the work) together with a variety of additional 
specialist drawings, specifications and schedules (e.g. 
reinforced concrete work, steelwork, mechanical and 
electrical equipment, etc.). 

To help in the production of specifications and bills of 
quantities, various systems of standardised texts, split into 
units or paragraphs, can be included or omitted as required. 
The suitability and acceptability of the various systems 
depends on the regulations of each country and profession 
(e.g. National Building Specification and Standard 
Measurement of Works in’ the UK, and_ the 
Standardleistungsbuch and LV-Muster in Germany). 

Manufacturer's information in relation to materials and 
equipment, offers additional, useful information § in 
application and installation techniques, constructional 
details and necessary safety precautions. 

In general, in relation to tender action, the use of suitable 
computer software which links CAD drawings with 
specifications and bills of quantities is recommended.

3.2 Aims/risks of construction supervision 
Construction supervision consists of two major elements: 
Control, measurement, accounting in relation to the 
contract conditions and plan of work, and building 
programme planning through the use of project 
management techniques (availability of people, machines, 
material at the right time, in the right amount, at the right 
place). Important aids include operation planning 


* *K 





45 





46 


techniques and time planning techniques using various 
recognised methods. 

Poor building supervision and insufficient control lead, 
among other things, to unsatisfactory execution of the 
works, faults (obvious or hidden), faulty measurements and 
payments for work, additional costs, and danger to 
operatives (accidents) and materials. Unsatisfactory project 
management and poor co-ordination normally lead to 
building delays and extra costs. 


3.3 Means and tools of construction supervision 

Standard procedures vary according to the country and 
profession, together with techniques/instruments for 
project management. Supervision of the works, 
measurement of works and accounting is based on the 
drawings (production drawings, detail drawings, special 
drawings), specifications, schedules, possibly a bill of 
quantities, and the contract conditions. 

The techniques of operation and time planning make use 
of various common methods: bar charts, line diagrams and 
networks. 

Bar charts (according to Gantt, bar drawings), show the 
work stages/trade duties on the vertical (Y) axis, and the 
accompanying building duration or time duration 
(estimated by experience or calculation) on the horizontal 
(X) axis. The duration of the various stages/duties are 
shown by the length of the particular bars (shown running 
horizontally). 

Building stages which follow on from another should be 
depicted as such on the chart. The description of the 
building stages and trade categories help in the setting up 
of the bar chart, and make possible the comparison of the 
planned programme and the actual progress of the work. 

* Advantages: provides a good overall view: Clarity; 
ease of interpretation (type of presentation shows 
time scales) 

* Disadvantages: strict separation of work tasks; no 
identification of sub-tasks; difficult to show 
connections and dependence relationships of the 
work stages (thus critical and non-critical sequences 
are not identified, and if altering the time duration of 
one stage will result in the alteration of the duration 
of the whole project) 

* Context of use: illustration of straightforward, self- 
contained building projects which have a simple 
sequence of tasks and no directional element (e.g. as 
in road construction), planning of individual tasks, 
resource planning (staffing programme/equipment 
and plant planning) > @) p. 49 

Line diagrams -  speed-time  distance-time (or 
quantities-time diagrams) — show measures of time 
(selected) on the one axis (which ones depending on the 
building task), and measures of length (or, less frequently, 
building quantities) on the other axis. The speed of the 
production process (the slope of the line), and the division (in 
terms of time and space between tasks) are clearly portrayed. 

* Advantages: clear presentation of speed of progress 
and critical separations 

* Disadvantages: poor portrayal of parallel and layered 
task sequences (spacing and timing of tasks which 
have no directional element) 

* Context of use: illustration of building projects with a 
strong directional element, e.g. length, height,(roads 
or tunnels) or (towers or chimneys) > @) p. 49 

Networks resulting from network planning techniques (as 
part of operational research) — (3) p. 49 help in the analysis, 
presentation, planning, directing and control of tasks. The 
relationships between different operations show how they 
are influenced by many possible factors (e.g. time, costs 
and resources). 

To calculate the overall project duration, assume a 
project starting point at time PT, and show (calculating 





CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT 


forward) the earliest point in time ET (earliest time of start 
event EST/ earliest time of finish event EFT) for each task (D 
= duration, time span, beginning/finish of the task). The 
overall project duration is the duration of project path 
(critical path)/project finish time ET,. Incorporating 
estimated float (buffer time) elements (added together) 
produces the given project finish time point PT... To 
determine the latest project start time, perform a backward 
pass (from right to left), taking the latest time point LT 
(latest time of start event LST, latest time of finish event 
LFT) for each task (calculating backwards), and hence the 
latest project start time for the project PT, respectively the 
total float TF of the individual tasks = (latest time point LT — 
latest start/finish LST/LFT) — (earliest time point — earliest 
start/finish EST/EFT) > @ p. 49 

The critical path method (CPM) puts task arrows into 
order. Nodes show the start or finish events of the tasks. 
The fundamental arrangement. of relationships (= 
dependence between tasks, quantifiable) in CPM is the 
normal sequence (order relationship from the finish of the 
previous to the beginning of the following; finish event of 
task A = start event of task B). The time frame is determined 
(i.e. the task is allotted a definite estimated duration time). 
Tasks which are running parallel and are dependent on each 
other, dependencies of parts of tasks with each other which 
are a condition for the progress of a further task, are 
displayed as dummies (dummy arrows, order relationships 
in the network with time interval of 0). » 4) + @) p. 50 

The content of the critical path chart mirrors the list of 
tasks (list of individual activities together with timing 
estimates). > @) p. 50 

The metra-potential method (MPM) orders the task 
nodes. Arrows display the order relationships. The 
fundamental arrangement of relationships with MPM is the 
order of starts (order relationship between the start of the 
previous task to the start of the following task; start event of 
task A = start event of task B). The time frame is determined 
(as with CPM). The content of the task node network mirrors 
the list of tasks (compare with CPM). »@, @, @ p. 50 

The programme evaluation and review technique (PERT) 
orders the task nodes. Arrows display the order 
relationships. The time model is normally stochastic (i.e. 
the determination of the time intervals between the events 
is by probability calculations). Geometric models of PERT + 
CPM can be combined in a mixed presentation (tasks as 
arrows, and events as nodes). Theoretically, an event 
arrow-network plan is feasible; however, no practical 
method ts available. 

Advantages/disadvantages/appropriate applications of 

the various network planning methods: 

* Pre-organised networks with deterministic time 
model (CPM/MPM) are the most suitable for detailed 
direction/control of building operations (emphasis on 
individual tasks). 

* Event-orientated networks (PERT) are more suitable 
for strategic planning and overview of the project 
(events = milestones). 

* Task node networks (MPM) are easier to set up and 
alter (consistent separation of tasks planning/time 
planning), and reproduce a greater number of 
conditions than task arrow networks (CPM; however, 
CPM is more widely used in practice, being older, 
more developed, and because 70-80% of ordering 
relationships which occur in network plans are 
standard sequences). 

Networks are primarily very detailed but are difficult to read, 
so additional presentation of the results as a 
barchart/diagram is necessary. Computers are predestined 
to be an aid, particularly in setting up large networks 
(resulting from entries of relevant data from the list of tasks). 
Suitable software is available (the majority being for CPM).

THE BUILDING SITE 
Foundations, Excavation, Trenches 


Surveying, site investigation, appraisal 

Failure to accurately assess the building site and water table 
conditions and to specify the correct foundations generally 
leads to irreparable structural damage and serious cost 
overruns. 

Lateral ground displacement due to the load on the 
foundations causes the foundations to sink into the ground 
or become laterally displaced. This leads to total failure of 
the foundations. 

Settlement due to compression of the building site under 
the foundations due to the load on the foundations and/or 
loads caused by neighbouring structures leads to 
deformations and damage (cracks) in the superstructure. 

Where there is adequate local knowledge of the nature, 
mechanical properties, stratification and bearing strength of 
the sub-soil layers, calculations can be made which 
determine the dimensions of shallow foundations 
(individual and strip foundations; foundation pads and 
rafts) and deep foundations (pile foundations). If such 
knowledge is not available, timely investigation of the 
ground is required, if possible in consultation with an 
appropriate expert. This involves examination of the strata 
by excavation (manual or mechanical excavator), borings 
(auger/rotary bit or core drilling) with the extraction of 
samples and probes. The number and depth of inspections 
required depends on the topography, type of building and 
information available. 

The depth of the ground water table can be investigated 
by inserting measuring pipes into boreholes and taking 
regular measurements (water table fluctuations). The 
ground water samples should also be tested to assess 
whether it is aggressive towards concrete (i.e. presence of 
sulphates, etc.). 

Ground probes (and sample cores) are used to 
investigate granular composition, water content, 
consistency, density, compressibility, shear strength and 
permeability. Probes provide continuous information on 
soil strength and density as they penetrate the various sub- 
soil layers. 

All test results and the opinion of an expert site 
investigator should be brought to the attention of the 
building supervisors. 

Consult local and national standards for ground (rock) 
descriptions, classification of earthworks, sub-soil 
characteristics, stratification, ground water conditions, 
necessary foundation/excavation depths, calculation of 
excavation material quantities, and construction and safety 
of excavations.

of the sides of the excavation 
depends on the ground type; 
the sandier the soil, the flatter 
the slope » @). 

After excavation, string 
lines are tightly stretched 
between the site boards » @) 
to mark out the external 
dimensions of the building. 
The outside corners of the 
house are given at the 
crossing points of the lines by 
plumb bobs. The correct level 
must be measured — (7). 
Dimensions are orientated by 
fixed points in the 
surroundings. Setting boards

3m long, with a level built-in 
or fixed on top, are installed 
horizontally with the ends 
Supported on posts. Inter- 
mediate contour heights are 
measured with a scaled rod. 

A water-filled, transparent, 
flexible hose 20-30m long, 
with glass tube sections at 
each end marked out in mm, 
when held vertically, is used 
to read water levels. After 
calibrating by holding both 
glass tubes together, levels 
between points on the site 
can be compared accurately 
to the mm, without the need 
for visual contact (e.g. in 
different rooms).

EARTHWORKS AND FOUNDATION 
STRUCTURES 


VI MtOoCciI VOII(£s 


Technical investigations of the ground should provide 
sufficient data for efficient construction planning and 
execution of the building work. Depending on the 
construction type, the ground is evaluated either as 
building (for foundations), or as building material (for earth 
works). Building structures are planned (if legally possible 
and with local approval), according to expert assessment 
(i.e. avoiding marshy areas, landfill, etc.). The building 
construction type and the prevailing ground conditions 
affect the design of the foundations, e.g. individual footings 
+ @, strip foundations — ©), raft foundations + (6), or if the 
ground strata are only able to carry the load structure at 
greater depth, pile foundations — (0. Pressure distribution 
must not extend over 45° in masonry, or 60° in concrete. 
Masonry foundations are seldom used, due to high cost. 
Unreinforced concrete foundations are used when the load 
spreading area is relatively small, e.g. for smaller building 
structures. Steel reinforced concrete foundations are used 
for larger spans and at higher ground compression; they 
contain reinforcement to withstand the tensile loads .» 47) + 
(2. Reinforced, instead of mass, concrete is used to reduce 
foundation height, weight and excavation depth. For 
flexible joints and near to existing structures or boundaries

when load-bearing capacity is lower, or if individual 
footings or strip foundations are inadequate for the 
imposed load. Frost-free depth for base > 0.80m, for 
engineering structures 1.0-1.5m deep. 


Methods to improve the load-bearing capacity of the site 
Vibratory pressure process, with vibrator, compact in a 
radius of 2.3-3m; separation of the vibration cores approx. 
1.5m; the area is thus filled; improvement depends on the 
granulation and original strata. Ground compression piles: 
core is filled up with aggregate of varied grain size without 
bonding agent. Solidification and compression of the 
ground: pressure injection of cement grout; not applicable 
to cohesive ground and ground which is aggressive to 
cement; only applicable in quartzous ground (gravel, sand 
and loose stone); injection of chemicals (silicic acid 
solution, calcium chloride); immediate and_ lasting 
petrifaction.

Pile foundations: Loads can be transmitted by the piles to the 
4) Building structures rated for the retention of soil pressure load-bearing ground by surface friction, end bearing or both 


bearings; the type of load transfer depends on the building site 
and the nature of the piling. Bearing pile foundations: load 
transmission takes place at ends of the piles onto the load- 
bearing ground and/or through skin friction. Suspended pile 
foundations: the piles do not extend downwards until the ends 
are on the load-bearing region. Weak load-bearing layers are 
compacted by pile driving. 

Type of load transfer: Friction piles essentially transfer the load 
through surface friction via the load bearing region around the 
circumference of the pile. End bearing piles: the load is principally 
transmitted by the pile end on to the bearing stratum; in this case, 
surface friction is not significant. The permissible end pressure is 
significantly increased in some types of pile by widening the 
bases of the piles. 

Position of the piles in the ground: Foundation piles are in the 
ground over their whole length. Retaining and projecting piles 
are free standing piles, whose lower portions only are below 
ground; the tops of these piles are exposed and therefore 
subject to buckling stresses. 

Materials: wood, steel, concrete, reinforced concrete and 
prestressed concrete piles. 

Method of insertion in the ground: Driven piles are rammed 
into the ground by pile driving hammers. Jacked piles are 
inserted by pressure. Bored piles are inserted by way of a bore 
hole. Screwed piles are inserted by rotation. With driven tube 
piles, a steel tube former is driven into the ground and 
withdrawn as the concrete pile is cast in situ. A distinction is

piles provide the advantage 
that their length is not critical

ground strata obtained during

BUILDING AND SITE DRAINAGE 


External underground drains are understood to be those 
which are laid outside the plan area of the building. Drains 
underneath cellar areas are taken as interior drains. 
Depending on topography, the depths required are 0.80m, 
1.00m and 1.20m. In severe climates, measures must be 
taken to protect against frost. 

Changes in direction of main drains must be constructed 
only with prefabricated bend fittings and no individual bend 
should be greater than 45°. If a junction of drains cannot be 
formed with prefabricated fittings, then a manhole must be 
constructed. Inaccessible double junctions are not 
permitted and a drain must not be reduced by connection 
into a narrower pipe in the direction of flow (with the 
exception of rainwater drainage outside buildings).

BUILDING AND SITE DRAINAGE 


Calculation of foul water flow 
The deciding factor in calculating the size of the nominal 
bore is the maximum expected foul water discharge Ve, 
which is given by the sum of the connection values and/or, 
if appropriate, the effective water consumption, while 
taking into account the simultaneous use of the various 
sanitary fittings. 
V,=K-. SAW, + V,. 

Guide values for the drainage discharge factor K are shown 
in @) and example connection values AW, are given in (3). 

If the foul water discharge V. is smaller than the largest 
connection value of an individual sanitary fitting, then the 
latter value is to be taken. For drainage systems that do not 
fit into the categories of building listed in @, K values 
should be calculated according to individual specific uses.

BUILDING AND SITE DRAINAGE 


Dimensioning of drainage systems following the 
connection of a pump installation 

Non-pressurised drainage following a pump installation is 
to be calculated as follows. 

(a) With rainwater drainage, the pumped flow from the 
pump V,, is to be added to the rainwater discharge V.. 
(b) With foul water and combined drainage, the relevant 
highest value (pumped flow or the remaining effluent 
flow) is to be taken, under the condition that the addition 
of V, and V,, or V, does not result in a complete filling of 
the underground or above-ground drainage pipework. The 
calculated testing of the complete filling of pipes is only to 
be carried out on pipes for which there is a filling level of 
h/d, = 0.7. lf there are several foul water pump installations 
in a combined underground/above-ground drainage 
system, then the total pumped flow of the pumps can be 

reduced (e.g. for every additional pump add 0.4 V,). 


Dimensioning of foul drain pipes: connecting pipes . (3) 
Single connecting pipes from hand basins, sink units and 
bidets, which do not have more than three changes of 
direction (including the exit bend of the trap) can be 
constructed from nominal bore 40 pipes. If there are more 
than three changes of direction, then a nominal bore 50 
pipe is necessary. 


Internal collecting drainage 

With unventilated internal collection drains, the drain length 
L, including the individual connection furthest away, should 
not exceed 3m for nominal bore 50 pipe, 5m for nominal 
bore 70, and 10m for pipes with a nominal bore of 100 
(without WC connection). Where greater lengths are 
required, wider bores or the use of ventilated pipework 
should be considered. Internal collection drain pipes over 
5m in length with a nominal bore of 100, WC connections 
and falls H of 1m or more must be ventilated.

BUILDING AND SITE DRAINAGE 


Foul water stacks 

The nominal bore of all foul water stacks must be at least DN 70. 
For foul water stacks with top ventilation the figures given in (1) 
should be used for design calculations. The nominal bores 
shown for the stacks considered are associated with the 
maximum sum of the connection values with which the stack 
can be loaded. It should be noted that to avoid functional 
disruptions a limit is put upon the number of WCs (i.e. sanitary 
units that introduce quantities of large solid objects and surges 
of water) that may be connected to the various stacks. In 
addition to foul water flows, tables 1) - @) also show examples 
of sums of connection values (see p. 56). 

Foul water stacks with secondary ventilation can be loaded 
with 70% more foul water flow than stacks with top ventilation. 
They can be estimated in accordance with ->» (3). 

Calculations governing underground and above-ground 
collection pipes (horizontal foul water drains) should be made 
based on the ratio h/d; = 0.5 although for under-ground pipes 
outside the building over DN 150 can use h/d, = 0.7. The values 
for the partial fill discharge flow of the pipes with minimum falls 
Imin are identified in relation to whether the pipes are laid inside 
or outside the building. Values below the given size steps are 
allowed for pipe calculations only in individually justified cases. 


Calculations for rainwater pipes: rainwater discharge 
and rainfall value 

The discharge from a rainfall area is calculated using the 
following relationship: 


6) V.=w-A 10000 in I/s 
where V, = rainwater discharge in I/s 
A = connected rainfall area in m2 
Min) = rainfall value in I/(s- ha) 
y = discharge coefficient according to — @) 


Rainwater drainage pipes inside and outside buildings are 
fundamentally to be calculated with a minimum rainfall value of 
at least 300I/(s- ha). It is also important to ensure that there are 
enough emergency overflows for large internal rainwater 
drainage systems. The requirements can be checked using the 
following standard figures for the location: 

51) Fifteen minute rainfall value, statistically exceeded 
once per year. This rainfall value should only be 
used in exceptionally well reasoned cases for the 
calculation of rainwater drainage pipe sizes. 

fs(9.5) Five minute rainfall value, statistically exceeded 
once every two years. 

519.05) Five minute rainfall value, statistically seen is 
exceeded once every twenty years. 

For above- and underground drains within a building, subject to 
agreement with local guidelines, a rainfall value of less than 300 
can be employed, though it must be at least as great as the five 
minute rainfall value in two years (f5.95)). Across Germany, 
f5(9.5) Varies from around 165 up to as much as 4451I/(s- ha) so it 
is important to check the figures with the local authority. 

If smaller rainfall values are proposed and there are large 
roof drainage areas (e.g. above 5000 m2), it is necessary to carry 
out an Overloading calculation on the basis of what can be 
expected in the case of rainfall equivalent at least to a five 
minute rainfall value in 20 years (16/9 95)). These rainfall values 
can be as high as 9501/(s- ha). Within the overload sector, take 
into account the resistances due to the layout of the pipes. If a 
special roof form is proposed (e.g. those with areas of planned 
flooding) they must be waterproofed to above the flood level 
and the additional loads must be taken into consideration. 

Underground rainwater drainage pipes should have a 
nominal bore of DN 100 or more. If the pipe is outside the 
building and for mixed drainage (i.e. will also carry foul water), 
and connects to a manhole with open access, the nominal bore 
should be DN 150 or above.

Cellars are used less these days as storage rooms and more 


as places for 


leisure or 


as additional rooms for 


accommodation and domestic purposes. So, people want 
greater comfort and a better internal climate in the cellar. A 
prerequisite for this is proofing against dampness from 
outside. For buildings without cellars, the external and 
internal walls have to be protected from rising damp by the 
provision of horizontal damp-proof courses — @) - 6). On 
external walls, the damp-proofing is 150-300mm above 
ground level — @)- ©). For buildings with brick cellar walls, 
a minimum of 2 horizontal damp-proof courses should be 
provided in the external walls = @-@). The upper layer may 
be omitted on internal walls. Bituminous damp-proof 
membranes, asphalt, or specifically designed high-grade 
plastic sheet should be used for the vertical tanking in walls. 
Depending on the type of back filling used in the working 
area and the type of tanking used, protective layers should 
be provided for the wall surfaces — @2 - (4. Rubble, gravel 
chippings or loose stones should not be deposited directly 
against the tanking membrane.

DAMP-PROOFING AND TANKING 
Ground Water Drainage 


Ground water drainage involves the removal of water from 
the building site area through drainage layers and 
drainpipes to prevent the build-up of water pressure. This 
process should prevent blocking by soil particles (fixed filter 
drainage). A drainage facility consists of perforated drains, 
inspection and cleaning devices, and drainage pipes for 
water disposal. Drainage is the collective term for drain 
pipes and drainage layers. If drainage at the wall is 
necessary, reference should be made to the cases. - (1)- (3. 
-+ @) is relevant if ground dampness only occurs in very 
porous ground. > () is relevant if the accumulation of water 
can be avoided by means of a drain, so that water under 
pressure does not occur. » (3) is relevant if water is present 
under pressure, as a rule in the form of ground water, or 
when removal of the water via a drain is not possible.

DAMP-PROOFING AND TANKING 


If the precipitation on the site is not absorbed quickly, a 
build-up of water pressure can occur and tanking against 
the water pressure is needed, with drainage to conduct 
water away. For these measures (1) - (3); for tanking 
methods > 4) - (9. 


Water pressure 

If parts of buildings are immersed in ground water, a water 
pressure retaining barrier layer (tanking) must be 
positioned over the base and side walls. To plan this design, 
the type of subsoil, the maximum ground water level and 
the chemical content of the water must be known. The 
tanking should extend to 300mm above the maximum 
ground water level. The materials can be 3-layer asphalt or 
specially designed plastic membranes, with metal fittings if 
necessary. 

When the water level has sunk below the cellar floor 
level, the protective walls are constructed on the concrete 
base layer and rendered ready to receive the tanking. After 
the tanking is applied, the reinforced floor slab and 
structural cellar walls are completed hard against the 
tanking. NB the rounding of the corners » 6) - (7). The 
tanking must be in the form of a complete vessel or enclose 
the building structure on all sides. Normally, it lies on the 
water side of the building structure » @)- (7. For internal 
tanking, the cladding construction must be able to 
withstand the full water pressure -» (2.

MASONRY 
Natural Stone 


Masonry in natural stone is referred to as random rubble, 
squared, dressed, ashlar, uncoursed, coursed, etc. > (1) - 40. 
Stone quarried from natural deposits should be laid in the 
orientation as found in the quarry » (1), @), @, to give an 
attractive and natural appearance; this is also better from a 
Structural viewpoint, as the loading is mainly vertical in pressure 
between the courses. Igneous stone is suitable for random, 
uncoursed masonry > (2). The length of the stones should be 
four or five times their height, no more, and certainly no less 
than the stone height. The stones’ size is of great significance to 
the scaling of a building. Attention must be paid to good 
bonding on both sides. In natural masonry, the bonding should 
show good craftsmanship across the whole cross-section. 
The following guidelines should be observed: 
(a) Nowhere on the front and rear faces should more than 
three joints run into each other. 
(b) No butt joint should run through more than two courses. 
(c) There must be a minimum of one header on two- 
stretcher courses, or the header and stretcher courses 
should alternate with one other. 
(d) The depth of the header must be approx. 1.5 times the 
height of a course and not less than 300mm. 
(e) The stretcher depth must be approx. equal to the course 
height. 
(f) The overlap of the butt joints must be >100mm (masonry 
courses) and 150mm on ashlar walling -» 6) - (%. 
(g) The largest stones should be built in at the corners > (1)- 6). 
The visible surfaces should be subsequently pointed. 
The masonry should be levelled and trued for structural bearing 
every 1.5-2.0m (scaffold height). The mortar joints should be 
<30mm thick, depending on coarseness and finish. Lime or lime 
cement mortar should be used, since pure cement mortar 
discolours certain types of stone. In the case of mixed masonry, the 
facing layer can be included in the load-bearing cross-section if the 
thickness 2120mm > @Q). Front facing (cladding) of 25-50mm 
thickness (Travertine, limestone, granite, etc.) is not included in the 
cross-section and the facing is anchored to the masonry with non- 
corroding tie-rods, with a 2mm separation from it —> (10).

concrete, thermal insulation, foam-filled concrete, clinker, 
dry walling, cavity closer and quoin blocks. All masonry 
work must be horizontally and vertically true, and properly 
aligned in accordance with regulations. On double leafed 
masonry > (/) + @), floors and roof must be supported only 
by the inner leaf. Masonry leafs should be joined with a 
min. of 5 stainless steel wire ties, 3mm in diameter, per sq. 
m. The ties are separated 250mm vertically and 750mm 
horizontally.

MASONRY 
Bricks and Blocks 


Masonry walling has to be braced with lateral walls and the 
tops restrained by upper floors (cellular principle). Bracing 
walls are plate-like components which stiffen the structure 
against buckling > p. 63 44. They are rated as supporting 
walls if they carry more than their own weight from one 
storey. Non-supporting walls are plate-like components 
which are stressed only by their own weight and do not 
provide buckling support. Recesses and slots have to be cut 
out or positioned in the masonry bonds. Horizontal and 
slanting recesses are permitted, but with a slenderness 
ratio of < 140mm and thickness > 240mm under special 
requirements > p. 63 (5. Ties should be provided for 
connection between external walls and partition walls 
acting as bracing walls that transmit horizontal loads. 
Horizontal reinforcement is required in structures of more 
than two complete storeys or which are more than 18[t]m 
long, if the site conditions demand it, or where there are 
walls with many or large openings (if the sum of the 
opening widths is more than 60% of the wall length, or 
where the window width is over 2/3 of the storey height or 
more than 40% of the wall length).

MASONRY 
Bricks and Blocks 


Solid masonry walling comprises a single leaf, where the 
facing work is attached to the background masonry by a 
masonry bond. Each course must be at least two bricks/ 
blocks in depth, between which there is a continuous, cavity- 
free longitudinal mortar joint of 20mm thickness. The facing 
leaf is included in the load-bearing cross-section »+p. 63. 

In double leaf walling without cavity, for load 
considerations, only the thickness of the inner leaf is taken 
into account. For calculating the slenderness ratio and 
spacing of the bracing components, the thickness of the 
inner shell plus half the thickness of the outer is used. If 
regulations allow it the cavity can be completely filled 
(double leaf cavity walling with insulating cavity fill). 

Double leaf cavity walling without cavity fill min. 
thickness of inner leaf »(@); outer leaf > 115mm; the air gap 
should be 60mm wide; the leafs are connected by ties + 
-~ (2). The outer leaf must be supported over the whole area 
and attached at least every 12m. The air gap is to extend 
from 100mm above the ground to the roof, without 
interruption. The outer leafs are to be provided with 
ventilation openings top and bottom, on every 1500mm? 
wall area (including openings). Vertical movement joints are 
to be provided in the outer leaf, at least at the corners of the 
building, and horizontal movement joints should be 
provided at the foundation level -» @). 

Reinforced masonry: wall thickness 2115mm; 
block/brick strength classification >12, mortar Ill; joints with 
<20mm reinforcement; steel diameter < 8mm, <5mm at 
crossover points. 

Wall types, wall thicknesses: Evidence must be provided 
of required structural wall thicknesses. This is not necessary 
where the selected wall thickness is clearly adequate. When 
selecting the wall thickness, particular attention should be 
paid to the function of the walls with regard to thermal and 
sound insulation, fire protection and damp-proofing. Where 
external walls are not built of frost resistant brick or stone, 
an outer rendering, or other weather protection should be 
provided. 

Supporting walls are predominantly subjected to 
compressive stresses. These panel type structural elements 
are provided for the acceptance of vertical loads (e.g. floor 
and roof loads) and horizontal loads (e.g. wind loads).

EXTERNAL WALLS 


Low-energy Building 
Construction 


The thermal insulation 
characteristics of external 
walls iS an important 
element in the saving of 
thermal energy. The insu- 
lation provided by low 
energy building construc- 
tion is greatly affected by 
the connections between 
the various building compo- 
nents. Significant heat 
losses can occur in these 
locations. Standard cross- 
sections depicting various 
types of building materials 
indicate the insulation 
values which can be 
achieved. A large range of 
building materials are 
available, such as concrete, 
masonry, timber, insulation 
materials, plaster, cork, 
reeds and clay. Clay has 
proved itself as a building 
material for thousands of 
years. It is the most 
common and most tested 
material in the world and, 
biologically and ecologically, 
iS an exemplary material. 
Finished clay insulation 
products are now available 
and are well suited to

FIREPLACES 


Every open fire must be connected to its own separate flue 
and should be immediately adjacent to the next »(U)- ©. 
Flue cross-sections must be matched to the size of the open 
fire > (8). The effective height of the flue from the smoke 
hood to the chimney mouth should be = 4.5m. The angle of 
a connecting flue to the main flue should be 45°. (9) - a0). 
Open fires must not be sited in rooms with less than 12 m2 
floor area. Only wood with a low resin content, and beech, 
oak, birch or fruit tree timber with few knots, should be used 
for burning. In the case of the use of gas appliances, 
reference should be made to the relevant regulations. 

Air for combustion must come from outside and needs 
to be able to enter even if the doors and windows are 
airtight. Air admission openings can usefully be sited in the 
base of the fire, or at the front, and ducts that introduce air 
to a position close to the fireplace opening should be 
provided -> (7). 

The fireplace opening must be separated from 
combustible materials and built-in furniture by at least 
800[t]mm to the front, above and to the sides _ »(6)-(7). Open 
fires must be constructed from non-combustible materials 
that satisfy local regulations and must be of stable 
construction. The floor, walls and grate and the smoke hood 
should be made from fire clay bricks/slabs, fire resistant 
concrete or cast iron (although the grate and hood are often 
metal). Any bricks or stones used must be of suitable type 
for chimney construction. Smoke hoods can be made from 
2mm steel brass, or copper sheet.

CHIMNEYS AND FLUES 


Flues and chimneys are ducts in and on buildings, which are 
intended exclusively to convey the gases from fireplaces to the 
outside over the roof. The following should be connected to a 
flue: fireplaces with a nominal heat output of more than 20kW:; 
gas fire places with more than 30kW; every fireplace in buildings 
with more than five full storeys; every open fire and forge fire; 
fireplaces with a means of opening and every fireplace with a 
burner and fan. 

Provision should be made in the foundation plans to support 
the weight of the fireplace, flue and chimney. Flues must have 
circular or rectangular internal cross-sections. The cross-section 
must be >100cm2, with a shortest side of 100mm. Brick flues 
must have a shortest internal side of length > 135mm, the longer 
side must not exceed 1.5 times the length of the shorter. The 
shortest effective flue height > 4m; for gaseous fuels > 4m. The 
mouth of the chimney should be => 400mm above the apex of the 
roof, where the roof slope is greater than 20° and for roof slopes 
less than 20° this dimension is > 1m .» ©. Where chimneys are 
closer to structures on the roof than between 1.5 and 3 times the 
height of the structure, it must be ensured that they clear the 
structure by at least 1m. Where the mouth of a chimney is above 
a roof which has a parapet which is not closed on all four sides, 
it must be at least 1m above the parapet. Every flue must have 
a 2 100mm wide by = 180mm high cleaning opening which is at 
least 200mm lower than the lowest fireplace connection. 
Chimneys which cannot be cleaned from the mouth opening, 
must have an additional cleaning opening in the flue in the roof 
space or in the chimney above the roof. The following materials 
may be used for single skin flues: light concrete blocks, clay 
bricks, lime sandstone -solid bricks, foundry bricks. 

Materials for treble-skinned chimneys, with outer casing, 
insulation layer and moveable inner lining can be formed 
components in light concrete or fireclay for the inner lining; for 
the outer casing, formed components in light concrete, masonry 
stone, bricks with vertical perforations, lime sandstone, foundry 
bricks, or aerated concrete blocks. For the insulating layer, non- 
combustible insulating material must be used. Exposed outer 
surfaces of the chimney in the roof space should be provided 
with a rough cast finish of at least 5-10mm thickness. Flue walls 
must not be loadbearing. The chimney can be clad with slates, 
shingle slates or cement fibre sheets. Zinc or copper sheet can be 
fixed to the chimney on to the sub-structure using dowels (not 
wooden dowels). Prefabricated claddings are recommended.

VENTILATION DUCTING 


Extract fan units should meet the ventilation requirements 
of bathrooms and lavatories in residential and non- 
residential buildings (such as schools, hotels and guest 
houses) and extract air from one or several rooms into an 
extract duct > ()- @). Ventilation systems should be sized 
for a minimum of 4 complete changes of air in the rooms 
which need to be ventilated. A flow of 60m3/h is adequate 
for bathrooms with a toilet and a flow of 30m3/h is adequate 
for one toilet. Every internally sited room to be ventilated 
must have a non-closable ventilation opening. The size of 
the area through which air flows must be 100mm? for every 
m3? of room volume. Gaps around the door may be taken as 
equivalent to 250 mm2. In bathrooms, the temperature must 
not fall below 22°C, due to the flow of air. 

The velocity of flow in the living area should be > 0.2m/s. 
The exhausted air must be led outside. Each individual 
ventilation system must have its own main duct > @)- ©). 

Central ventilation systems have common main ducting 
for a number of living areas — (4)- ©. 

The effective functioning of branching duct convection 
ventilation systems depends essentially on the available 
cross-section area of duct available per connection -» (). 
The cross-section of the ventilation shaft for single-duct 
systems without mechanical extract > (7) in bathrooms and 
WCs without open windows (up to 8 storeys) should be 
1500 mm2 per room.

SERVICES: CONNECTIONS 


In houses for one and two families there is no necessity for 
a mains connection room. 

Mains connections rooms should be planned in 
collaboration with the mains service providers. They must be 
in locations which can be accessed easily by all (e.g. off the 
staircase or cellar corridor, or reached directly from outside) 
and they must not be used for through passage. They have to 
be on an outside wall, through which the connections can be 
routed —> (1)- @). Walls should have a fire resistance of at least 
F30 (minutes). Doors should be at least 650/1950mm. With 
district heating schemes, the door must be lockable. A floor 
gully must be provided where there is connection to water or 
district heating mains. Mains connections rooms must be 
ventilated to the open air. The room temperature must not 
exceed 30°C, the temperature of the drinking water should not 
exceed 25°C, and the room must not be susceptible to frost. 

For up to 30 dwellings, or with district heating for about 
ten dwellings, allow the following room size: clear width 
>1.80m, length 2.00m, height 2.00m => @). For up to 
approximately 60 dwellings or where there is district heating 
for 30 dwellings: 1.80m wide, 3.5m long, 2.0m high.

ROOF STRUCTURES 


Couple roofs represent the most economical 
solution for low building widths. 


Collar roofs are never the cheapest for slopes under 
45°, but are suitable for large free span roofs. 


Simply supported roofs are always more expensive 
than couple roofs and are only used in exceptional 
cases. 


Roofs with two hangers (vertical posts) almost 
always are the most economical construction. 


Purlin roofs with three hangers are only considered 
for very wide buildings. 


>>? )? 


Roofs form the upper enclosure of buildings, protecting 
them from precipitation and atmospheric effects (wind, 
cold, heat). They comprise a supporting structure and a roof 
cover. The supporting components depend on the materials 
used (wood, steel, reinforced concrete), roof slope, type and 
weight of roof covering, loading, etc. Loading assumptions 
must comply with current regulations (dead-weight, live 
loads, wind and snow loadings). A distinction is made 
between roofs with and without purlins, because of their 
different structural system, and of the different functions of 
the supporting components. However, these two types of 
construction may be combined. The different types of load 
transfer also have consequences for the internal planning of 
the building.

ROOF STRUCTURES 


In a purlin roof, rafters have a subordinate function (round 
section timber spars also possible for small spans). Purlins 
are load-bearing beams, conducting loads away from the 
rafters to the supports. Regular supports are required for 
the purlins (trusses or cross-walls). Early type: ridge purlin 
with hanger. Double pitch purlin roofs have at least one 
hanger, situated in the centre of the roof. Suitable when the 
length of the rafters < 4.5m; on wider house structures, with 
rafter length > 4.5m, then two or more purlins with suitable 
vertical hangers are required. A rafter roof (rigid triangle 
principle) is possible in simple form, with short rafters up to 
4.5m. If the rafters’ length exceeds 4.5m, intermediate 
support is required in the form of collars. This regular, 
strong system of construction provides a support-free 
internal roof space. Couple close roofs require a strong 
tensile connection between the feet of the rafters and the 
ceiling beams. Sprocketed eaves are a common feature, 
giving a change of angle in the roof slope. Simple couple 
and collar roof construction is unsuitable for large roofs. 
Collar roofs are suitable for building widths to approx. 
12.0m, rafter lengths up to 7.5m, collar lengths up to 4m. 
The collar roof is a three-link frame with a tension member. 
Prefabricated roof trusses are a very common form of 
structure for pitched roofs. While economical in the use of 
timber and light and easy to erect, they have the 
disadvantage of totally obstructing the roof space.

ROOF COVERINGS 


Thatched roofs are of rye straw or reeds, hand-threshed 
1.2-1.4m long on battens, 300mm apart with the thatching 
material laid butt-end upwards and built up to a thickness of 
180-200 mm. The life of such a roof is 60-70 years in a 
sunny climate, but barely half that in damp conditions. 
Shingle roofs use oak, pine, larch, and, rarely, spruce. Slate 
roofs are laid on = 25mm thick sheathing of >160mm wide 
planks, protected by 200 gauge felt against dust and wind. 
Overlap is 80mm, preferably 100mm. The most natural 
effect is given by ‘German slating’ > @2. Rectangular 
patterns are more suitable for artificial slates (cement fibre 
tiles) > @3. Tiles: choice of plain tiled, interlocking tiled, or

ROOF COVERINGS 


Cement fibre sheet roofs have corrugated sheets with 
purlins 700-1450mm apart with 1.6m long sheets, or 


1150-1175mm_ with 2.50m 


long sheets. Overlap: 


150-200 mm — @)-@). Metal sheet roofs are covered in zinc, 
titanium-coated zinc, copper, aluminium, galvanised steel

characteristic patina of copper is popular. Combinations 
involving aluminium, titanium-coated zinc and galvanised 
steel should be avoided, combinations with lead and high 
grade steel are quite safe. Copper roofs are impervious to 
water vapour and are therefore particularly suitable for cold 


roofs > p. 81. 


Roof load: calculation in kN per m2 of roof surface. Roof 
coverings are per 1m? of inclined roof surface without 
rafters, purlins and ties. Roofing of roof tiles and concrete

DORMERS 


When gable windows do 
not allow sufficient light into 
the attic then roof windows 
or dormer windows are 
required. The size, form and 
arrangement of dormers 
depend on the type of roof, 
its size and the light 
requirement. 

oe Triangular dormer 45° @ Gabled dormer 45° Dormers should all be of 
the same size and shape if 
possible. The shape, mater- 
ials used and the consistent 
use of details ensure har- 
monious integration into 
the roof slope. Normally, to 
avoid expensive trimming 
of rafters, the width of the 
dormers should conform to 
the rafter spacing.

LOFT SPACE 


Unoccupied roof space in old Alpine farmhouses served as 
‘stores’ for the preservation of harvested crops (hay, straw, 
etc.). They were open at the eaves, so that cold external air 
circulated around the roof area, the temperature being little 
different from the outside = (), so that snow would lie 
uniformly distributed on the roof. The living rooms below 
were protected from the cold by the goods stored in the 
roof space. If the roof space was heated, without adequate 
thermal insulation, the snow would melt and ice would 
build up on the roof — @). The installation of thermal 
insulation material under the ventilated roof alleviates the 
situation. Openings are arranged on two opposite sides of 
the ventilated roof space, each equivalent to at least 2% of 
the roof area which is to be ventilated. So that dampness 
can be removed, this corresponds on average to a slot 
height of 20mm/m > 6) - (0.

ROOF SLOPES AND FLAT ROOFS 


Cold roof | p. 81: constructed with ventilation under roof 
covering; critical in respect of through flow of air if the slope 
is less than 10%, therefore, now only used with vapour 
barrier. Warm roof in conventional form > (4): (construction 
including a vapour barrier) from beneath is roof structure — 
vapour barrier — insulation — weatherproofing — protective 
layer. Warm roof in upside-down format . p. 81: 
construction from beneath is roof structure - 
weatherproofing - insulation using proven material — 
protective layer as applied load. Warm roof with concrete 
weatherproofing — p. 81: built from underneath: insulation 
— concrete panels as roof structure and waterproofing 
(risky). Solid slab structure — must be arranged to provide 
room for expansion due to heat; consequently, flexible 
joints arrangement over supporting walls +p. 80 6)-(8) and 
separation of internal walls and roof slab (Styrofoam strips 
are first attached by adhesive to the underside of the slab). 
Prerequisites for correct functioning: built-in slope > 1.5%, 
and preferably 3% (or a build-up of surface water can 
result). 

Vapour barrier: if possible, as a 2mm roof felt 
incorporating aluminium foil on a loosely laid slip layer of 
perforated glass fibre mat on top of the concrete roof slab, 
treated with an application of bitumen solution as a dust 
seal. The vapour barrier is laid as far beneath the roof build- 
up as required to exclude condensation -» (2) + (3). 

Insulation of non-rotting material (foam); see 
dimensions in .» @; two-layer arrangement or single layer 
with rebated joints: ideally, interlocking rebates all round. 

Roof membrane on vapour permeable membrane 
(corrugated felting or insulating layer to combat bubble 
formation), triple layer using the pouring and rolling 
technique with two layers of glass fibre based roofing felt 
with a layer of glass fibre mat in between, or two layers of 
felt using the welding method with thick bitumen course 
(d>5mm). Asingle layer of sheeting is permissible, but due 
to risk of mechanical damage caused by the thinness of the 
layer and possible faulty seams, two layers offer additional 
safety. 

Protective layer should consist, if possible, of a 50mm 
ballast layer with 15-30mm grain size on a doubled hot 
brush applied layer on a separating membrane; prevents 
bubble formation, temperature shocks, mechanical 
stresses, and damage from UV radiation. Additional 
protection with 8-mm layer of rubber shred sheeting under 
the ballast layer. The joints should be hot sealed (a basic 
prerequisite for terraces and roof gardens). 


Essential detail points 

Outlets = p. 80 > @) - @ always thermally insulated, two 
draining levels, with connection also at the vapour barrier, 
to form an outlet then sealed against the drain pipe. For

The surface slope to the intakes should exceed 3%. A 
‘ventilator’ for the expansion layer is not required. The 
flexible joint should be continued to the edge of the roof » 
p. 80  &) - @). The edge details must be flexible, using 
aluminium or concrete profiles > p. 80 .» &) — (8) zinc 
connections are contrary to technical regulations (cracking 
of roof covering). Wall connection should be > 150mm 
above the drainage level and fixed mechanically, not by 
adhesive only. If steel roof decking is used as a load-bearing 
surface, the roof skin may crack due to vibration; 
precautions are required to increase the stiffness by using a 
thicker sheet or a covering of 15mm woodwool building 
board (mechanically fixed), to reduce the vibrations (gravel 
ballast layer) and crack resistant roof sheeting! The vapour 
barrier on the decking should always be hot fused (due to 
thermal conduction).

FLAT ROOFS 
Cold Roof Construction 


Roof terrace surfaces are loose laid in a bed of shingle or on 
block supports. Advantage: water level is below surface; no 
severe freezing. Roof garden has surface drainage through 
drainage layers, ballasting of shingle or similar, with a filter 
layer on top > p. 80 @0. 

Roofs over swimming pools, etc. are suspended ceilings with 
ventilated or heated void; see Table () -» p. 79. Usually, the 
contribution of all layers up to the vapour barrier, including the air 
boundary layer, gives a max. 13.5% of the resistance to heat 1/k. 

On wood -» (5) is a simple solution, and good value for 
money. NB: insulation above the vapour barrier should be 
thicker than with a concrete roof, not only due to the low 
surface weight, but also because the contribution of the layers 
up to the vapour barrier (air boundary layer + wood thickness) 
would otherwise be too high. 

An inverted roof > @) is an unusual solution with long-term 
durability (up to now, however, only achievable with various 
polystyrene foam materials). Shingle alone as the upper roof 
layering is insufficient in certain cases; it is better to have a 
paved surface. Advantage: quickly waterproof, examination for 
defects is easy, no limit to use. Insulation 10-20% thicker than 
for a normal warm roof. 

With a concrete roof — (1), due to the position of the 
insulation, condensation occurs in certain conditions, which 
always dry out in the summer; unsuitable for humid rooms. The 
risk is dependent on the care taken by the manufacturer to avoid 
cracks due to the geometry (shrinkage) and solving the problem 
of connections to, and penetrations of, the concrete. 

A completely flat cold roof -+ 6) - (8) is only allowable with 
vapour barrier: diffusion resistance — pp. 111-14 of the inner 
skin > 10m; the air layer here is only for vapour pressure 
balance, analogous to the warm roof, as it does not function 
properly as a ventilation system unless the slope is at least 10%. 
Layer sequence > ©) and (8). NB: inner skin must be airtight; 
tongue and groove panelling is not. Insulation » p. 79. 
Waterproofing as for warm roof — p. 80. Slope > 1.5%, 
preferably 3% -— important for drainage. Inlets should be 
insulated in the air cavity region; use insulated inlet pipes > (9). 
It is necessary for the vapour barrier to be unbroken (tight 
overlapping and wall connections, particularly for swimming 
pools; unavoidable through-nailing is permissible). 

On light constructions, the internal temperature range 
should be improved by additional heavy layers (heat storage) 
under the insulation. Unfavourable internal temperature range: 
temperature fluctuations almost the same as those outside 
implies an internal climate similar to that of an unheated army 
hut; this cannot be improved by thermal insulation alone. A 
quick response heating system and/or additional thermal mass 
is required. For the artificial ventilation of rooms under cold 
roofs, always maintain a negative pressure; otherwise, room air 
will be forced into the roof cavity.

ROOF GARDENS 





History 
The concept of roof gardens and roof cultivation had 
ft te aa i already been exploited by the Babylonians in biblical times 
yw LY B by 6008c. In Berlin, in 1890, farm house roofs were covered 
mt r\ : with a layer of soil as a means of fire protection, in which 
Tal an gies ie L vegetation seeded itself. Le Corbusier was the first in our 
. it AX: ls ee @ century to rediscover the almost forgotten green roof.

@ Various types of roof cultivation 


ROOF GARDENS 


Roof slope 
The slope of a double pitch roof should not be greater than 
25°. Flat roofs should have a minimum slope of 2-3%. 


Types of roof cultivation 

Intensive cultivation: the roof is fitted out as a domestic 
garden, with equipment such as pergolas and loggias; 
continual attention and upkeep are necessary; planting — 
grass, shrubs and trees. Extensive cultivation: the 
cultivation requires a thin layer of soil and requires a 
minimum of attention; planting — moss, grass, herbs, 
herbaceous plants and shrubs. Mobile cultivation: plants in 
tubs, and other plant containers serve for the cultivation of 
roof terraces, balustrades and balconies. 


Watering 

Natural watering by rain water: water is trapped in the 
drainage layer and in the vegetation layer. Accumulated 
water: rain water is trapped in the drainage layer and is 
mechanically replenished if natural watering is inadequate. 
Drip watering: a water drip pipe is placed in the vegetation 
or drainage layer to water the plants during dry periods. 
Sprinkling system: sprinkling system over the vegetation 
layer. 


Fertiliser 
Fertiliser can be spread on the vegetation layer or mixed 


with the water during artificial watering.

ROOF GARDENS 


Roof Construction 


For the vegetation layer, expanded clay and expanded slate 
are used, these materials offering structural stability, soil 
aeration, water storage potential and lending themselves to 
landscaping. Problems to be solved: storage of nutrients, soil 
reaction (pH value), through-ventilation, water storage. The 
filter layer, comprising filter material, prevents clogging of 
the drainage layer. The drainage layer prevents excessive 
watering of the plants and consists of: mesh fibre mats, foam 
drainage courses, plastic panels and protective structural 
materials. The protective layer provides protection during the 
construction phase and against point loading. The root 
protection layer of plants, etc., are retained by PVC/ECB and 
EPDM sheeting. The separating layer separates supporting 
structure from the roof cultivation. Examples = @ - ® 
illustrate a range of customary flat roof structures and 
variations incorporating roof cultivation. Before roof 
cultivation is applied, the integrity of the roof and of the 
individual layers must be established. The technical 
condition of the roof surface must be carefully checked. 
Attention should be paid to: construction of the layers 
(condition); correct roof slope; no unevenness; no_ roof 
sagging; no waterproofing membrane faults (bubbles, 
cracking); expansion joints; edge attachments; penetrating 
elements (light shafts, roof lights, ventilating pipes); and 
drainage. Double pitch roofs can also be cultivated, but much 
preparatory construction work is needed when inclined roofs 
are cultivated (danger of slippage, soil drying out) -» (9)- 42.

Transition from road (16) Transition from footpath to 
surface to intensive roof intensive or extensive 
cultivation cultivation 


Definitions 

(1) Extensive roof cultivation implies a protective covering 
that needs upkeep, replacing the customary gravel 
covering. 

(2) To a large extent, the planted level is self-replenishing 
and the upkeep, i.e., maintenance, is reduced to a 
minimum. 


Scope 

These guidelines apply to areas of vegetation without 
natural connection to the ground, particularly on building 
roofs, and roofs of underground garages, shelters, or 
similar structures. 


Principles of constructive planning and execution 

(1) In extensive roof cultivation, the cultivated area acts as 
a protective covering — see the recommendations for 
flat roofs. 

(2) Roof construction and structure: the relevant structural 
and constructional principles of the building and its roof 
must be carefully interrelated with the technical 
requirements imposed by the vegetation and its 
supporting elements. 

(3) The surface loading required to secure the waterproof 
membrane is the minimum weight per unit area of the 
operative layers in accordance with the table below, 
taken from the Roof Garden Association 
recommendations for planting on the flat roofs. 

(4)

8-20 at least 130 65 
over 20 _ at least 160 60 


(5) The type of construction employed in the roof and the 
degree of surface loading are dependent on the wind 
loading, the height of the building and the surface area 
of the roof. 

(6) High suction loads can occur around the edges and 
corners of the roof over a width °/g > 1m < 2m.

(9) Cultivated roofs should be designed to be easily 
maintained, i.e. areas which need regular attention 
(such as roof drainage inlets, structures which protrude 
from the cultivated area, expansion joints and wall 
Junctions) should be easily accessible. 

(10)In these areas, the protective layer should comprise of 
inorganic materials such as shingle or loose stones. 
(11) These areas should be linked with the roof drainage 
inlets, so that any overflow from the planted areas can 

drain away. 

(12)Large surface areas should be subdivided into separate 
drainage zones. 


Requirements, functions, constructive precautions 

(1) The waterproofing membrane should be designed in 
accordance with the recommended specifications for 
flat roofs. 

(2) The development of the cultivated area should not 
impair the function of the roof waterproofing membrane. 











ROOF CULTIVATION 


Extract from Guidelines of the Roof 
Garden Association 


(3) It should be possible to separate the waterproofing 
layers from the cultivation layers, i.e. it must be possible 
to inspect the waterproof membrane of the roof. 

(4) The root protection layer must provide durable 
protection to the roof waterproofing layers. 

(5) High polymer waterproofing membranes should, 
because of their physical and chemical makeup, be able 
to satisfy the demands of the root protection layer. 

(6) If a bituminous roof waterproofing system is applied, 
then bitumen-compatible root protection layers should 
be employed. 

(7) The root protection layer should be protected from 
mechanical damage by a covering; non-rotting fibre 
mats should be used since these can store nutrients and 
additional water. 

(8) The vegetation layer must have a high structural 
Stability and must exhibit good cushioning capability 
and resistance to rotting. 

(9) The pH value should not exceed 6.0 in the acidic range. 

(10) The construction of the layers must be capable of 
accepting a daily precipitation level of at least 30/m2. 

(11) There should be a volume of air of at least 20% in the 
layer structure in the water saturated condition. 


Maintenance at the plant level 

(1) Wild herbaceous plants and grasses from the dry 
grassland, steppe and rock crevice species should be 
used in the planted areas. All plants used should be 
perennial. 

(2) The plants used should be young plants, sown as seed 
or propagated by cuttings. 

(3) Maintenance: at least one routine per year, when the 
roof inlets, security strips, roof connections and 
terminations are inspected and cleaned as necessary. 

(4) Plants, mosses and lichen which settle are not 
considered as weeds. 

(5) All undesirable weeds should be removed. 

(6) Woody plants, in particular willow, birch, poplar, maple 
and the like, are considered to be weeds. 

(7) Regular mowing and fertilising should be carried out. 

(8) Changes at the plant level may occur through 
environmental effects. 


Fire prevention 

(1) All fire precaution recommendations should be 
observed. 

(2) The requirements are fulfilled if the flammability of the 
Structure is classed as flame resistant (material 
classification B1). 


Characteristics of a satisfactory roof cultivation 

An extensive planted area has planting out, sowing, setting 
of cuttings, pre-cultivated plants (plant containers, mats and 
panels). The vegetation layer provides stability for the plants, 
contains water and nutrients and allows material and gas 
exchange and water retention. The vegetation layer must 
have a large pore volume for gas exchange and water 
retention. The filter layer prevents the flushing out of 
nutrients and small components of the vegetation layer and 
silting up of the drainage layer. It also ensures that water 
drains away gradually. The drainage layer provides safe 
removal of overflow water, aeration of the vegetation layer, 
the storage and, if necessary, a water supply. Root protection 
protects the roof waterproofing membrane from chemical 
and mechanical contact with the roots of the plants which, in 
searching for water and nutrients, can be destructive. Roof 
construction must be durably waterproof, both on the 
surface and in all connections with other components. The 
formation of condensation water in the roof structure must 
be effectively and permanently prevented.

TENSILE AND INFLATABLE 
STRUCTURES 


The construction of awnings and tensile roofs is becoming 
more widespread. These constructions vary from simple 
awnings and roofs, to technically very complicated tensile 
structures of the most diverse types. 

Materials: artificial fibre material (polyester) is used as 
the base fabric, with corrosion resistant and weather proof 
protective layers of PVC on both sides. 

Characteristics: high strength (can resist snow and wind 
loads); non-rotting; resistant to aggressive substances; 
water and dirt repellent, and fire resistant. 

Weight: 800-1200 g/m2. 

Permeability to light: from ‘impermeable’ up to 50% 
permeability. 

Life: 15-20 years; all popular colour shades; good colour 
fastness 

Workability: manufactured in rolls; widths 1-3m, usually 
1.5m; length up to 2000 running metres; cut to shape to suit 
structure; can be joined by stitching, welding, with 
adhesives, combinations of these, or by clamp connectors. 


Add-on standard systems (1) 
Standard units allow the structure to be extended 








indefinitely, often on all sides. They embrace most 
planforms: square, rectangular, triangular, circular, 
k i A polyhedra. Application: connecting passageways, rest area 
11.50 —-- pavilions, shade awnings, etc. 
(1) Standard add-on systems Framed structures 


A supporting frame is made from wood, steel or aluminium, 
over which the membrane is stretched as a protective 
covering. Application: exhibition halls, storage and 
industrial areas. 


ventilation 








Air supported structures — (4) 

The structural membrane is supported by compressed air at 
low pressure, and air locks prevent the rapid release of the 
supporting air. The system can be combined with heating, 
and additional insulation can be provided by an inner shell 
(air mattress). Maximum width is 45m, with length 
unlimited. Application: exhibition, storage, industrial and 
sport halls; also as roofing over swimming pools and 
construction sites in winter. 





P+ 650 


Tensioned structures -> (6) 

The membrane is supported at selected points by means of 
cables and masts, and tensioned around the edges. To 
improve thermal insulation, the structure may be provided 
with additional membranes. Span can be up to more than 
100m. Application: exhibition, industrial and sports halls, 
meeting and sports areas, phantom roofs.

CABLE NET STRUCTURES 


Cable net structures offer the possibility of covering large 
unsupported spans with considerable ease. The German 
pavilion at the World Exhibition in Montreal in 1976 was 
constructed in this fashion > (@) + @), the Olympic Stadium 
in Munich, 1972 > @)-() and the ice rink in the Olympic Park 
in Munich > @0)- 43. An interesting example is also provided 
by the design for the students club for the University and 
College of Technology in Dortmund —  @). 

As a rule, the constructional elements are steel pylons, 
steel cable networks, steel or wooden grids, and roof 
coverings of acrylic glass or translucent, plastic-reinforced 
sheeting. 

Cables are fastened into the edges of the steel network, 
the eaves, etc., and are laid over pin-jointed and usually 
obliquely positioned steel supports, and then anchored. 

‘Aerial supports’, cable supporting elements which are 
stayed from beneath, divide up the load of the main 
supporting cable to reduce the cable cross-sections. 

The transfer of load of the tension cables usually takes 
place via cast components - bolt fixings, housings, cable 
fixings, etc. The cable fixings can be secured by self-locking 
nuts or by the use of pressure clamps.

SUSPENDED AND TENSIONED 
STRUCTURES 


The suspension or support of load-bearing structures 
provides a means of reducing the cross-sections of the 
Structural members, thus enabling delicate and filigree 
designs to be developed. As a rule, this is only possible in 
steel and timber skeletal structures. The tensioning cables 
are of steel and can usually be tensioned on completion of 
the structure. The cables support tensile forces only. 

Suspended structures have the purpose of reducing the 
span of supporting beams or eliminating cantilevered 
structures. Tensioned structures, likewise, reduce the span 
of beams and, hence, also the section modulus which has 
to be considered in determining their cross-section » (2). In 
similar fashion to cable network structures, aerial supports 
are required on trussed structures. They have to accept 
buckling (compressive) stresses. 

Significant contributions to the architecture of 
Suspended structures have been made by Gunter Behnisch 
- ©), Norman Foster -; @)- @, Richard Rogers; (6)-@) and 
Michael Hopkins — (8)-(). The Renault building in Swindon, 
by Norman Foster, consists of arched steel supports, which 
are suspended from round, pre-stressed hollow steel masts 
from a point in the upper quarter of the gable — (1)-@). The 
design enabled the ground area to be extended by 
approximately 67%. The suspended construction offers 
connection points which make it possible to execute the 
construction work without interfering with other work. 

The new Fleetguard factory in Quimper, for an automobile 
concern in the USA, had to be designed for changing 
requirements and operations. For this, Richard Rogers chose 
a suspended construction so to keep the inside free of any 
supporting structure — @)- (. The same design ideas form 
the basis of the sports halls of Gunter Behnisch -. 6) and the 
Schlumberger Research Centre in Cambridge, by Michael 
Hopkins > - @. An airport administration building 
(proposed design for Paderborn/Lippstadt) > (0) and a concert 
hall (proposed design for the Dortmund Fair) — a1) may also 
be built in this fashion.

SPACE FRAMES: PRINCIPLES 





Ideally, space frames should be constructed from equal 
sided and/or isosceles right-angled triangles, so that regular 
fevanedion: Atlsues! polyhedrons are formed. In plane infinite networks, there 
cube (6 faces) are exactly three geometric structures; in spherical finite 
octahedron _(8 faces) structures, there are exactly five regular polyhedron 
BURRS GdRON.. T1odaces! networks, which are comprised of only one type of joint, 
eee ma ee member, and hence also, surface. Regular plane networks 
are triangular, square and hexagonal. 

—» spherical network Of the five platonic bodies used, the space frame formula 
decrees that only those three-dimensional joint-member 
space frames whose members form a closed triangular 
network are kinematically stable, i.e. the tetrahedron, the 
octahedron and the icosahedron. The cube requires an 

G) Five platonic bodies additional 6, and the dodecahedron, an additional 24 


members, to become stable. If a spherical. triangular 
network is not closed over the whole surface, the basic 
polygon must be prevented from moving by an appropriate 


each joint in the three-dimensional alternative method. 


















































space must be fixed by three members The lengths of the members of a body for a space frame 
Eoaeo te Hees Mie aaa form a geometric series with the factor 2. One joint with a 
ae ae ae sa eigenal maximum of 18 connections at angles of 45°, 60° and 90° is 
sufficient for the construction of a regular framework. As 
with plane structures, it must be accepted that the members 
are connected with flexible joints.

SPACE FRAMES: APPLICATION 


The MERO space frame developed by Mengeringhausen 
consists of joints and members -» () - @). The underlying 
principle is that joints and members are selected from the 
frame systems as are appropriate for the loads which are to 
be carried. In the MERO structural elements, the 
joint/member links do not act as ‘ideal pin-joints’, but are 
able to transmit flexural moments in addition to the normal 
forces in the members » @ - (. This three-dimensional 
format permits a free selection of a basic grid unit, then, 
with the factors v2 and v3 to size the lengths of the 
members, to develop a structure to provide the required 
load-bearing surfaces > @2 - @ The unlimited flexibility is 
expressed in the fact that curved space frames are also 
possible. The Globe Arena in Stockholm - 43) is, at present, 
the largest hemispherical building in the world. The 
assembly methods involve elements of prefabrication, 
sectional installation or the slab-lift method. All the 
components are hot galvanised for corrosion protection. As 
a consequence of the high level of static redundancy of 
space frames, the failure of a single member as a result of 
fire will not lead to the collapse of the structure. Starting 
from spherical joints, that allow 18 different points of 
attachment for tubular members, a large variety of other 
joint systems between nodes and members have been 
developed so as to optimise the solution to load-bearing 
and spanning requirements -> (8) - @.

MULTISTOREY STRUCTURES 


The main choice is of in situ or prefabricated manufacture in the 
form of slab or frame construction. The selection of the materials 
is according to type of construction and local conditions. 

As in all areas of building construction, the number of storeys 
is limited by the load-bearing capacity and weight of the building 
materials. Construction consists of a vertical, space enclosing 
supporting structure made from structural materials with or 
without tensile strength. Vertical and lateral stiffening is necessary 
through connected transverse walls and ceiling structures. Frame 
construction, aS a non-space enclosing supporting structure, 
permits an open planform and choice of outer wall formation 
(cantilevered or suspended construction). A large number of floor 
levels is possible with various types of prefabrication. 

Structural frame materials: reinforced concrete — which 
provides a choice of in situ and prefabricated, steel, aluminium 
and timber. 

Types of structure: frames with main beams on hinged joints, 
or rigid frame units in longitudinal and/or transverse directions. 
Construction systems: columns and main beams (uprights and 
ties) determine the frame structure with rigid or articulated joints 
(connecting points of columns and beams). Fully stiffened 
frames: columns and beams with rigid joints are connected to 
rigid frame units. Articulated frame units one above the other: 
columns and beams are rigidly connected into rigid frame units 
and arranged one above the other with articulated joints. Pure 
articulated frames: nodal points are designed to articulate, with 
diagonal bracing structures (struts and trusses) and solid 
diaphragms (intermediate walls, gable walls, stairwell walls): 
mixed systems are possible. Rigid joints are easily achieved with 
in situ) and prefabricated reinforced concrete; however, 
prefabricated components are usually designed with articulated 
joints and braced by rigid building cores. 


Construction 

Framed structures with continuous vertical supports > (1) - O; 
ties beams rest on visible brackets or conceal bearings. Skeleton 
structures with sectional vertical supports — @)- (6); the height 
of the verticals can possibly extend over more than two storeys;

with suspended ties at the centre connection (articulated storey

construction - (Q): columns with four-sided cantilevered slabs 
(slabs and columns rigidly connected together, articulated 
connection of the cantilevered slab edges). Floor support 
structures directly accept the vertical loads and transmits them 
horizontally onto the points of support; concrete floor slabs of 
solid, hollow, ribbed or coffered construction are very heavy if 
the span is large, and prove difficult in service installation; use of 
the lift-slab method is possible, suitable principally for 
rectangular planforms > (0 - @2.

FLOORING 


Flooring has a decisive effect on the overall impression 
created by rooms, the quality of accommodation and 
maintenance costs. 

Natural stone floors: Limestone, slate or sandstone slabs 
can be laid rough hewn, in natural state, or with some or all 
edges cut smooth or polished | @)-@). The surfaces of sawn 
tiles, limestone (marble), sandstone and all igneous rocks 
can be finished in any manner desired. They can be laid in a 
bed of mortar or glued with adhesive to the floor sub-layer. 

Mosaic floors: Various coloured stones: (glass, ceramics 
or natural stone) are laid in cement mortar or applied with 
adhesives — @)- ©. 

Ceramic floor tiles: Stoneware, floor, mosaic and 
sintered tiles are shapes of coloured clay which are sintered 
in the burning process, so that they absorb hardly any 
water. They are, therefore, resistant to frost, have some 
resistance to acids and high resistance to mechanical wear, 
though they are not always oil resistant. 

Parquet flooring is made from wood in the form of 
parquet strips, tiles, blocks or boards > (7 - @3. The upper 
layer of the finished parquet elements consists of oak or 
other parquet wood, in three different styles >» 47) - 49. 

Pine or spruce are used for floor boarding. Tongue and

American red pine, pitch pine. 

Wood block paving (end grained wood) is rectangular or 
round, and laid on concrete — @3)- @4.

HEATING 


Heating systems are distinguished by the type of energy 
source and type of heating surface. 

Oil firing: nowadays, light. Advantages: low fuel costs 
(relative to gas, approx. 10-25%); not dependent on public 
supply networks fuel oil is the most widespread source of 
heating energy; easy to regulate. Disadvantages: high costs 
of storage and tank facilities; in rented housing, space 
required for oil storage reduces rent revenue; where water 
protection measures apply or there is a danger of flooding, 
this form of heating is only possible if strict regulations are 
observed; fuel paid for prior to use; high environmental cost. 
Gas firing: natural gas is increasingly being used for heating 
purposes. Advantages: no storage costs; minimal 
maintenance costs; payment made after usage; can be used 
in areas where water protection regulations apply; easy to 
regulate; high annual efficiency; may be used for individual 
flats or rooms; minimal environmental effects. 
Disadvantages: dependent on supply networks; higher 
energy costs; concern about gas explosions; when 
converting from oil to gas; chimney modifications are 
required. 

Solid fuels such as coal (anthracite), lignite or wood, are 
rarely used to heat buildings. District heating stations are 
the exception, since this type of heating is only economical 
above a certain level of power output. Also, depending on 
the type of fuel used, large quantities of environmentally 
damaging substances are emitted, so that stringent 
requirements are laid down for the use of these fuels 
(protection of the environment). Advantages: not 
dependent on energy imports; low fuel costs. 
Disadvantages: high operating costs; large storage space 
necessary; high emission of environmentally unfriendly 
substances; poor controllability. 

Regenerative forms of energy include solar radiation, wind 
power, water power, biomass (plants) and refuse (biogas). 
Since amortisation of the installation costs is not achieved 
within the lifetime of the plant required, the demand for this 
type of energy is correspondingly low. 

Remote heating systems are indirect forms of energy supply, 
as opposed to the primary forms of energy discussed above. 
Heat is generated in district heating stations or power 
stations by a combined heat/power system. Advantages: 
boiler room and chimney not required; no storage costs; 
energy is paid for after 
consumption; can be used 
where’ water protection 
regulations apply; environ- 
mentally friendly association 
Of power/energy coupling. 
Disadvantages: high energy 
costs; dependency on supply 
network; if the heating 
source is changed, a 
chimney must be fitted.

Electrical heating: Apart from night storage heating, the 
continuous heating of rooms by electrical current is only 
possible in special cases, due to the high costs of electricity. 
Electrical heating of rooms in temporary use may be 
advantageous, e.g. garages, gate keepers’ lodges and 
churches. Main advantages: short heating-up period; clean 
operation; no fuel storage; constant availability; low initial 
costs. 
Night storage heating is used for electrical floor heating, 
electrical storage heaters or for electrically heated boilers.

Correspondingly, for electrical storage heaters and 
electrically heated boilers, the energy storage elements are 
heated during the off-peak period. However, by contrast to 
the floor heating system, the latter two devices can be 
regulated. Advantages: neither a boiler room nor chimney 
is required; no gases are generated; minimal space 
requirement; low servicing costs; no need to store fuel. 
Convectors: Heat is not transferred by radiation, but by 
direct transmission to the air molecules. For this reason, 
convectors can be covered or built in, without reducing the 
heat output. Disadvantages: strong movement of air and

Gas heating systems 

Regulations and legislation (UK): the provision of gas 
supply into a building in England, Wales and Scotland is 
controlled by the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) 
Regulations, 1998, which revoke and replace the 1994 and 
1996 (amendment) regulations. They make provision for the 
installation and use of gas fittings for the purpose of 
protecting the public from the dangers arising from the 
distribution, supply or use of gas. 

One of the major tasks of the architect is to make sure 
that the design provisions, such as locations of meters and 
pipe routes, do as much as possible to make it easy for the 
installer to comply with the regulations. 

Gas fired appliances must be of an approved type and 
can only be installed in those spaces where no danger can 
arise from position, size, or construction quality of the 
surrounding building. Distances between components 
made of combustible materials and external heated parts of 
a gas appliance, or from any radiation protection fitted in 
between, must be sufficient to exclude any possibility of fire 
(i.e. >5cm). In addition, spaces between components made 
of combustible materials and other external heated parts, 
as well as between radiation protection and gas appliances 
or radiation protection, must not be enclosed in such a way 
that a dangerous build-up of heat can occur. Heaters with an 
enclosed combustion chamber fitted against external walls 
and housed in a box-like enclosure must be vented to the 
room, with bottom and top vents each having >600cmé free 
cross-section. Air vents must be arranged in accordance 
with details and drawings of the appliance manufacturer. 
The casing must have a clear space of >10cm in front and 
at the side of the heater cladding. Heaters not mounted on 
external walls must be fitted as close as possible to the 
chimney stack. 

The minimum size and ventilation of rooms containing 
heating appliances is determined by the output or sum of 
outputs of the heating appliances. For ventilated enclosed 
internal areas, the volume must be calculated from the 
internal finished measurements (i.e. measured to finished 
surfaces and apertures). 

All gas appliances, apart from portable units and small 
water heaters, must be fitted with a flue. Flues promote air 
circulation and help remove 
the bulk of gas in case the 
appliance is left with the gas 
unlit. Cookers should be 
fitted with cowls and vents 
which should considerably 
help to remove fumes and 
reduce condensation on 
walls. Bathrooms equipped 
with gas heaters must be 
fitted with adequate ventila- 
tion and a fiue for the 
heater. Flues for water 
heaters must include a 
baffle or draught diverter to 
prevent down-draugNts.

HEATING 


For uniform heating of the room air, convector heaters can 
be replaced by a floor heating system. Problems arise only 
where large window areas are involved, but this can be 
overcome by the installation of additional heating — such as 
floor convectors. 

In general, surface heating includes large areas of surface 
Surrounding a room and involves relatively low 
temperatures. Types of surface heating include floor 
heating, ceiling heating and wall heating. With floor heating, 
the heat from the floor surface is not only imparted to the 
room air, but also to the walls and ceiling. Heat transfer to 
the air occurs by convection, i. e. by air movement over the 
floor surface. The heat given to the walls and ceiling takes 
place due to radiation. The heat output can vary between 70 
and 110W/m2, depending on the floor finish and system 
employed. Almost any usual type of floor finish can be used 
— ceramics, wood or textiles. However, the diathermic 
resistance should not exceed 0.15m2k/W. 

House dust allergies can be a problem in heated rooms. 
Previously, precautions against house dust or dust mite 
allergy paid no attention to the effects of heating units. 
Heaters cause swirling of house dust containing allergens, 
which can then rapidly come into contact with the mucous 
membranes. In addition to this, there are insoluble difficulties 
in cleaning heaters which have convection fins. It is therefore 
advantageous if heaters are designed to embody the 
smallest possible number of convection elements and to 
have straightforward cleaning procedures. These 
requirements are fulfilled by single-layer panels without 
convection fins and by radiators of unit construction. 
Storage of heating oil: The quantity of heating oil stored 
should be sufficient for a minimum of 3 months and a 
maximum of one heating period. A rough estimate of the 
annual requirement for heating fuel is 6-101/m3 of room 
volume to be heated. A maximum volume of 5m3 may be 
stored in a boiler house. The container must be within a 
storage tank capable of accepting the total quantity. Storage 
containers in the ground must be protected from leakage, e.g. 
through the use of double-walled tanks, or plastic inner shells. 
Maximum capacities and additional safety measures are 
prescribed for areas where water protection regulations are in 
force. Within buildings, either plastic battery tanks with a 
Capacity per tank of 500-2000 litres may be installed, or steel 
tanks which are welded together in situ, whose capacities 
may be freely chosen. The tank room must be accessible. 

The tanks must be inspected for oil-tightness at regular 
intervals. In the event of an emergency, the tank room must 
be able to retain the full amount of oil. Tank facilities must 
have filling and ventilation pipe lines. Additionally, 
overfilling prevention must be incorporated and, depending 
on the type of storage, a leak warning system may be 
prescribed (e.g. in the case of underground tanks).

HEATING 


The floor screed for floor heating systems must satisfy local 
regulations. The thickness of the screed depends on the 
type of covering used, its preparation and the anticipated 
loading. A minimum covering over the heating pipes of 
45mm is prescribed when using cement floor screed and 
heating pipes which are directly above the thermal 
insulation. If there is no finish over the basic floor, then a 
minimum total depth of 75mm is required. The floor screed 
expands during use, and a temperature difference arises 
between the top and bottom surfaces of the screed. 

Due to the differential expansion, tensile stresses occur 
in the upper region of the layer. In the case of ceramic floor 
coverings, this can only be countered by top reinforcement. 
On carpeted floors or parquet floors, the reinforcement can 
be avoided, since the temperature drop between the upper 
and lower surfaces of the floor covering Is less than in the 
case of aceramic finish. Special requirements are contained 
in the thermal insulation regulations with respect to the 
limitation of heat transfer from surface heating, irrespective 
of the choice of type of insulation method: ‘In surface 
heating, the heat transfer coefficient of the component layer 
between the hot surface and the external air, the ground, or 
building section having an essentially lower internal 
temperature, must not exceed a value of 0.45W/m2’. 

The maximum permissible floor surface temperature for 
a permanently occupied area is 29°C. For the boundary zone 
it is 35°C, where the boundary zone is not to be wider than 
Im. For bathrooms, the maximum permissible floor 
temperature is 9°C above normal room temperature. 

Under normal conditions, floor heating is possible, since 
the heating requirement seldom lies above 90W/m2. In only 
a few exceptions (e.g. when there are large window areas, 
or when the room has more than two external walls) is 
there a greater heating requirement, and then additional 
static heating surfaces or air heating must be installed in 
addition to the floor heating.

HEATING: OIL STORAGE TANKS 


> pp. 98-9 
The fuel containment enclosures must be designed so that, if 
fluid escapes from a storage device, it is prevented from 
spreading beyond the enclosure area. The enclosures must be 
able to safely contain at least one-tenth of the volume of all the 
tanks it contains, and at least the full volume of the largest tank. 
Tanks in rooms: containment enclosures are required if the 
storage volume is = 4501, unless the storage tanks are of steel with 
a double wall. Tanks can have a Capacity of up to 100000I, with 
leakage indicator devices, or manufactured from glass fibre 
reinforced plastics of an approved type of construction, or they 
can be metal tanks with plastic inner linings of an approved form 
of construction. Containment enclosures must be constructed 
from non-flammable fire-resistant materials of adequate strength, 
leakproof and stability, and must not contain any Outlets. The 
tanks must have access on at least two sides with a minimum 
clearance of 400mm from the wall, or 250mm in other cases, and 
at least 100mm from the floor and 600mm from the ceiling -» (1). 

Classifications: 


A Flash point < 100°C 
Al Flash point < 21°C 
All Flash point 21-55°C 
Alll Flash point 55-100°C 


B Flash point < 21°C with water solubility at 15°C 

Outside tanks, above ground: containment enclosures are 
required for capacity >10001. Otherwise, conditions are as for 
tanks in rooms. Storage areas can be ramparts. For tanks 
>100m3 capacity, clearance to the ramparts, walls or ringed 
enclosures must be at least 1.5m. For vertical cylindrical tanks 
of capacity <2000m3 in square or rectangular catchment areas, 
clearance may be reduced to 1m. Arrangements must be made 
for the removal of water and these must be capable of closure. 
If water can discharge by itself, then separators must be built in. 
Above ground facilities require protected access. A distance of 
at least 3m from neighbouring facilities is required if there is a 
storage Capacity >500m° and correspondingly more as Capacity 
increases, to a clearance of 8m for a storage capacity of 
2000 m3. Access routes are required for fire-fighting appliances 
and equipment — @)- @). 
Underground tanks: >0.4m clearance of tanks from boundaries; 
>1m from buildings. Underground anchorage of the tanks is 
required to prevent movement of empty tanks in the presence 
of ground water or flooding. Backfilling is required to a depth of 
0.3-1m above the tanks. Also, 600mm diameter access 
Openings into the tanks are needed, serviced by a watertight 
shaft with a clear width of at least 1m, and 0.2m wider than the 
tank access opening lid. The shaft cover must be able to 
withstand a test proof loading of 100kN where vehicular access 
is to take place. Filling points are subject to approval for 
combustible fluids in hazard classes Al, All or B. They must be 
immediately accessible, with protected access. The ground 
surface must be impermeable and constructed of bitumen, 
concrete or paving with sealed joints. Drainage outlets with 
separators, overfilling protection, and emptying and washing 
facilities for tanker vehicles are required. 

Tankage facilities for the fuelling of all vehicles with 

combustible fluids in hazard classes Alll (e.g. heating oil and 
diesel fuel) must not be stored together with those in hazard 
classes Al, All or B. Neither must the effective regions of 
separators and operating surfaces of such storage areas

SOLAR ARCHITECTURE 


Components 








Essentially, economic considerations led architects and 
building developers to seek alternatives to the conventional 
fossil fuel sources of energy. Today, equal emphasis is 
placed on the ecological necessity for change. By means of 
energy conscious construction, the energy requirements of 
living accommodation can be reduced by around 50% in 
comparison to older buildings. 


Energy balance of buildings 
Solar energy is available free of charge to every building. 
Unfortunately, in many climatic areas, solar radiation is 
very low, so that other forms of energy must be used for 
room heating, hot water, lighting and for the operation of 
electrical appliances. 

The greatest energy losses from a building arise due to the 
conduction of heat through windows, walls, ceilings and roofs. 





Considerations of energy conscious construction 

There are three fundamental points which lead to a 

considerable reduction in the energy requirement of a 

domestic building: 

(1) Reduction of heat losses 

(2) Increase in energy saving through the use of solar 
radiation 

(3) Conscious efforts by users to improve the energy 
balance 

The choice of building location itself can reduce the heat 

losses from a building. Within a small area in a region, 

conditions will vary; e.g. wind and temperature conditions 

vary with the altitude of a building site. 

Relatively favourable microclimatic conditions result on 
south-facing slopes when the area of ground is situated on 
the upper third of the slope but away from the crest of the hill. 

The shape of the building plays an important role in 
Séptember terms of energy conscious construction. The outer surface 
of the building is in direct contact with the external climate 













10.0 
& and gives up valuable energy to the outside air. The design 
of the building should ensure that the smallest possible 
external surface is presented to the outside air in relation to 
the volume of the building. The shape to be aimed for Is a 
sc cube, although a hemisphere in the ideal case. However, 
this ideal assumption applies only to a detached house.

SOLAR ARCHITECTURE 


Organisation of the ground plan 
In the passive utilisation of solar energy, the heat is utilised 
through direct incident radiation and heat storage in 
specific structural components such as walls and floors. 
Because of the conditions under which solar energy is 
used passively, the arrangement of the ground plan 
necessarily follows a _ particular logical layout. The 
continuously used living and sleeping accommodation 
should be south-facing and provided with large window 
areas. It is useful to provide glazed structures in these living 
and sleeping areas. There are three important reasons for this: 
(1) Extension of the living area 
(2) Gain in solar energy 
(3) Provision of a thermal buffer zone 
The little-used low-temperature unheated rooms, with low 
natural light requirements should be north-facing. They act 
as a buffer zone between the warm living area and the cold 
outside climate. 


Use of solar energy 

In the use of solar energy, a distinction is drawn between 

the active and passive use of solar energy. 

The active use of solar energy necessitates the 
application of equipment such as solar collectors, pipework, 
collector vessels circulation pumps for the transfer of the 
solar energy. This system entails large investment and 
maintenance costs which must be recovered solely by 
saving in the cost of energy. As a result, such systems 
cannot be operated economically in single family houses. 

The passive use of solar energy necessitates the use of 
specific structural components as heat stores, such as 
walls, ceilings and glazed units. The efficiency of this 
system depends on specific factors: 

(1) Climatic conditions —- mean monthly temperature, solar 
geometry and incident solar radiation, hours of sunshine 
and level of incident energy radiation 

(2) Method of using the solar energy — indirect usage, direct 
usage 

(3) Choice of materials - absorption capability of the surface 
and heat storage capability of the materials

SOLAR ENERGY 


About 1.5m2 of collector 
area and about 1001! volume 
of water in the storage tank 
is needed per person in the 
household. » dG) A 30-pipe 
solar collector with an 
absorption surface of 3m? 
is needed to produce hot 
water for a  4-person 
household. The collector 
will produce about 
8.5-14.0kWh solar heat per 
day, depending on the 
amount of sunshine, i.e. 
enough to heat 200-2801 of 
water. » () Within the 
foreseeable future, the sun 
cannot provide enough 
power for heating, so solar 
heating installations still 
require a conventional 
heating system. 

There are two different 
technologies. Solar heat: 
thermal collection of solar 
energy using’ collectors 
(equipment which catches 
and accumulates _ solar 
thermal energy). Thermal 
energy is used to heat 
water. Solar electricity: 
photovoltaics is the direct 
conversion of the sun’s rays 
into electrical energy (direct 
current) with the help of 
solar cells. 


Air movement is caused by pressure differences, i.e., disturbances 
to the state of equilibrium, resulting from:

(a) Arrangement of ventilation and air conditioning systems 


Room ventilation systems are used to guarantee a specific 
room climate. In fulfilling this objective, the following 
requirements must be satisfied, depending on the application: 
(a) Removal from rooms of impurities in the air including 
smoke and other harmful substances, and suspended 
particles 
(b) Removal of perceptible heat from rooms: unwanted 
quantities of both hot and cold air 
(c) Removal of latent heat from rooms: enthalpy flows of 
humidifying air and dehumidifying air 
(d) Protective pressure maintenance: pressure maintenance in 
buildings for protection against unwanted air exchange. 
Most of the requirements under (a) are solved through 
continuous replacement of air (ventilation) and/or suitable air 
treatment (filtering). Requirements of type (b) and (c) are 
usually met by appropriate thermodynamic treatment of the air, 
and, to a limited degree, by air replacement. Requirements of 
type (d) are solved by various types of mechanical control of 
supply and extraction air. 


Natural ventilation 

Uncontrolled air is admitted through joints and gaps in window 
frames, doors and shutters (as a result of the effects of wind) 
rather than through the walls. However, the increased use of 
thermal insulation measures in buildings means that the natural 
sources of ventilation through gaps in windows and doors may 
no longer be adequate. It may therefore be necessary to provide 
controlled ventilation in living accommodation, using mechanical 
ventilation systems and, if necessary, to replace the heat lost as a 
consequence. 

Window ventilation -» ©)- (8) p.179 is generally adequate for 
living rooms. Sash windows are favourable, where the outside 
air is admitted at the bottom and internal air flows out above. 

Intensive ventilation is brought about by mechanical 
ventilation systems. In accordance with the building 
regulations, this is a requirement for windowless bathrooms 
and WCs, with the removal of air to the outside via ducting. 
Allowance should be made for the requirement of a flow of 
replenishment air through ventilator grills, windows and/or 
gaps in the fabric of the building. Furthermore, as far as is 
possible, draught-free admission of the outside air must be 
provided. 

The installation of simple ventilator grills in outside walls for 
inflow and outflow of air leads to the danger of draughts in the 
winter. Mechanical ventilation systems are better. 








VENTILATION AND AIR CONDITIONING 


Humidity of room air 

For comfort, the upper limit for the moisture content of the air 
is 11.5kg of water per kg of dry air. A relative humidity of 65% 
should not be exceeded. The minimum flow of fresh air per 
person for cinemas, banqueting halls, reading rooms, 
exhibition halls, sale rooms, museums and sports halls is 
20m3/h. The value for individual offices, canteens, conference 
rooms, rest rooms, lecture halls and hotel rooms is 30m42/h: it is 
40m3/h for restaurants, and 50m3/h for open plan offices.

Several handling stages are usually involved in ventilation and 
air conditioning. Filtering; air heating; air cooling; and washing, 
humidifying and evaporative cooling are discussed on this 
page. For ventilation and damping -> p. 107. 


Filtering 
Air cleaning to eliminate coarse dust particles: 

(a) Oiled metal filter plates in air filter chambers or 
automatic circulation filters; used particularly for the 
ventilation of industrial premises. Disadvantage: 
entrainment of oil mist. 

(b) Dry layer filter mats made of textile or glass fibre in metal 
frames; not recoverable; also as roll tape filter with 
automatic cleaning. 

Fine cleaning and separation of fine soot 

(c) Electrostatic air filter; the dust is ionised and deposited 
on negatively charged metal plates. Very low air 
resistance. Disadvantages: large filter chambers; 
cleaning with warm water. 

(d) Fine filtering through filter media of paper, or glass fibre. 
Advantages: cheap to manufacture; no corrosion from air 
containing harmful substances; high operating safety. 
Disadvantage: greater air resistance than electro filters, 
which increases as the filter is soiled, leading to 
disruption of the air flow. 

(e) Air washing: removes dust or aerosols and acid fumes, 
but not soot, and therefore should not be used in areas 
with many oil-fired heating installations.

(4) Air filter classes 


Air heating 

(a) Controllability is limited with simple gravity-circulation 
solid-fuel heating installations. 

(b) Controllability is good with natural gas and heating oil, 
and with electrically heated equipment. 

(c) Heating with low-pressure steam, warm and hot water, 
using finned tube radiators made from galvanised steel 
or copper tube with copper or aluminium fins. Good, 
simple controllability. No need for local chimneys and 
flues. 


Air cooling 

Used principally for industry when constant temperature and 
humidity must be maintained over the whole year, also for 
commercial buildings and office blocks, theatres and cinemas in 
summer. 

(a) Cooling of the air with mains water or spring water. At a 
temperature of 13°C, spring water should be allowed to 
drain back again as much as possible on account of the 
ground water table level. In most towns, the use of mains 
water for cooling is not permitted and is uneconomical 
anyway, due to the high price of water. Spring water 
systems require the approval of the water authorities. 


VENTILATION AND AIR CONDITIONING 


(b) Compression cooling systems for room air conditioning 
must accord with strict regulations and must use non- 
poisonous refrigerants such as Freon 12 or Freon 22 (F12, 
F22), etc. If the cooling plant is in the direct vicinity of the 
central air conditioning area, direct evaporation of the 
refrigerant should take place in the cooling radiators of 
the air conditioning plant. Since 1995, substances 
containing CFCs are prohibited. 

In large installations, cooling of the water takes place 
within a closed circuit, with distribution by pumps. 
Advantages: the central cooling plant can be in an area 
where noise and vibration are not troublesome; very safe 
in Operation. Today, compact cold water systems and 
prefabricated air conditioning/cooling units are available. 
For large cooling installations 

(d) Compression of the refrigerant in a sealed unit turbo 
compressor (complete machine installation with 
compressor, water-cooler and condenser), low vibration 
and very low noise levels. 

(e) Absorption cooling facility with lithium bromide and 
water. Due to the vaporisation of the water, heat is 
extracted from the water to be cooled; water vapour is 
absorbed by the lithium bromide and continuously 
evaporated in the cyclic process, then condensed again 
and passed to the first vaporisation process. Very low 
noise levels; vibration-free system requiring little space. 

(f) Steam jet cooling: A high velocity steam jet induces a 
negative pressure in a vessel. Circulating cooling water 
becomes atomised and vaporised, with simultaneous 
cooling. The cold water is transferred to the air coolers of 
the air conditioning plant. This method of cooling is 
employed in industrial applications. 

The condenser heat must be disposed of in all mechanical 
cooling systems. Various means are employed for this purpose, 
e.g. water cooled condensers, which are cooled by spring water 
or circulating water, and air cooled condensers. On water- 
cooled condensers, the spring water installation requires 
approval by the local water authorities. Also, careful checks 
should be made as to whether the spring water contains any 
aggressive substances which would damage the condensers in 
the cooling installation. If appropriate, sea water resistant 
condensers must be used (cost factors). 

A return cooling system is necessary on circulating water 
installations (cooling tower). In the cooling tower, circulating 
water is sprayed by jets. The water then flows over layers of 
granular material and is blown through with air (evaporative 
cooling). The cooling towers should be sited away from 
buildings or, better still, be sited on the roofs of buildings, due 
to the level of noise generated. The same applies to air cooled 
condensers. 


QO 


Washing, humidifying, evaporative cooling 

Air washers provide humidification for dry air (when correctly 
set) and, to a certain degree, they can also provide air cleaning. 
By means of saturation, i.e. increasing the absolute water 
content of the air in the washer, ‘evaporative cooling’ can take 
place at the same time; this provides the possibility of cheap 
cooling for industrial air conditioning facilities in areas where 
the outside air is of low humidity. The water is very finely 
atomised in the air washer, through the use of pumps and jet 
sprays. The sprays are housed in galvanised steel sheeting or 
watertight masonry or concrete. An air rectifier or water-control 
sheeting prevents the escape of water into the conditioning 
chamber. 


Other humidifying devices 
(a) Evaporation vessels on heating elements or atomisers. 
(b) Centralised device with steam or electrically heated 
evaporation vessels (disadvantage is scaling). 
(c) Rotating atomisers (aerosol apparatus) — only usable 
where low volumes of air are involved 


The efficiency of a good ventilation design can be 80-90%, 
depending on the application. Both radial and axial fans 
produce the same noise levels up to a total delivery pressure of 
approx. 40mm head of water. Above this level, axial fans are 
louder and they are used particularly in industrial construction. 
Special foundations are provided with damping elements to 
isolate vibration levels.

Sound damping 

Sound dampers are provided in air ducts to reduce noise from 
installed machinery into the air-conditioned rooms. The length 
of these in the direction of air flow is 1.5-3m, depending on the 
damping to be achieved. The design may embody baffles made 
from non-combustible material, e.g. moulded fibre boards or 
from sheeting with a rockwool filling. The requirements for 
sound insulation in building construction should be observed. 

Ducts and air outlets and inlets are in galvanised steel sheet, 
high-grade steel or fire-resistant fibre board or similar. Ideally, 
the cross-section should be square or round, or rectangular 
with an aspect ratio of 1:3. Regular servicing is necessary, and 
the requirements for fire protection of ventilation systems must 
be observed. 

Masonry or concrete built ducts are more economical than 
sheet construction for large floor or rising ducts. Masonry ducts 
dampen noise better than concrete. The insides should be 
smoothly plastered and have a washable surface coating. Air 
entry ducts should be provided with lightweight insulation only, 
so that heat retention is avoided. The duct cross-sections 
should be large enough for cleaning (soiling impairs the 
condition of the air). So, the floor air-exhaust ducts should be 
equipped with drainage pipes or channels with sealed screwed 
connections and the air ducting should have adequate access 
openings for cleaning purposes. 

Cement fibre ducts (asbestos-free) are suitable for moist, 
non-acid containing air and plastic ducts for aggressive, 
gaseous media. Inlet and outlet gratings should not be sited in 
accessible floor areas (except in industrial construction and 
electronic data processing rooms). Air outlets are crucial for the 
distribution of air in rooms; the flow should be directed 
horizontally and vertically. Grilles for air inlets and outlets 
should be designed from an air conditioning standpoint, but 
should also be easy to clean —- ideally made from stove 
enamelled sheet. »(1)-@) 

The introduction of air into offices should, when possible, be 
at a window (point of most pronounced passage of cold and 
heat). Air removal should be on the corridor side. For theatres, 
cinemas and lecture rooms, admit air under the seats, and 
remove through the ceiling. This method depends on the shape 
and usage of the room. 


VENTILATION AND AIR CONDITIONING 


Plant rooms 

Air conditioning and ventilation systems should be considered 
during preliminary planning, as they have a major influence on 
building design and construction. Plant rooms should be as 
near as possible to the rooms to be air-conditioned, provided 
this is acoustically acceptable, and have good accessibility. The 
walls should be of masonry, plastered, with a washable coating, 
preferably tiled. 

Floor drainage should be provided in all compartments, and 
have traps and airtight removable covers. Where plant rooms 
are above other rooms, watertight floors should be provided. 
External walls need insulation and vapour barriers, to avoid 
damage by condensation. The extra floor loading for machinery 
in a plant room can be 750-1500kg/m2, plus the weight of the 
walling of the air ducting. In situations where there are 
extremely high requirements for noise and vibration reduction, 
consideration should be given to flexible mounting and 
isolating a plant room as a ‘room within a room’. 

Space requirements for air conditioning equipment are very 
much dependent on the demand for air filtering and sound 
damping. In narrow, long floor shapes, the compartments can 
be arranged in sequence, one after the other. 

© Simple industrial conditioning systems: approx. 12m long 

© For full air conditioning systems: approx. 16-22m long 

© For air extract systems: approx. 4-6m long.

20-40 000 4.0 3.5 room centre

An additional 1.5-2m should be allowed for assembly and 
maintenance access. In the case of large installations, for 
heating and air conditioning distribution systems, allowance 
should be made for common maintenance access and space for 
the control panel. 


Air conditioning systems for large offices 

It is useful to use several conditioning systems for large and 
open planned rooms. An isolated conditioning zone can be 
installed in the facade area (high-velocity systems) and a 
separate area for the internal zone, with low pressure or high 
velocity systems — (@).

High-pressure air conditioning systems 

To meet the demand for heat in winter and cooling in 
summer, large cross-sections of low-pressure air 
conditioning systems are needed - it is not for ventilation. 
High-pressure air conditioning systems require only 
approx. '/3 of the usual air quantities: they use external air 
for ventilation while transporting heat and cold through 
water pipes (1m of water can transport approx. 3450 times 
more heat than 1m of air). An air conditioning convector 
unit (with special air outlet jets and a heat exchanger) 
installed under every window is supplied with conditioned 
air and cooled or heated water. Regulation takes place only 
at the heat exchanger. Smaller quantities of air enable 
smaller control rooms to be used and with acceptable air 
conditioning. The external air is cleaned using a pre-filter 
and a fine filter. The whole building is at a slight positive 
pressure with respect to the outside, so that any air gaps in 
the building fabric have virtually no effect. 


Air conditioning convectors 

General requirements: noise intensity < 30-33 phon; air filter 
for cleaning the secondary air; heat exchanger must be able 
to ensure full heating to room temperature in any weather, 
even without the ventilation air system: cold water 
temperature in summer must be 15-16°C, or the cooling 
operation will be uneconomical and condensation will form 
on window systems (soiling of cooling surfaces). For ideal 
flow conditions without vibration, high-pressure air 
ductwork should be of round section where possible. With 
a vertical arrangement of supply lines and window spacings 
of 1.5-2m, alternate the structural columns with vertical 
service ducts containing the air ductwork and water pipes. 
Rising air ductwork for buildings with 7 storeys are 
175-255mm_ diameter. For taller buildings, separate

supplies lines are needed for each 7-10 storeys and a storey 
devoted to the installation of heating and ventilation plant. 
A more expensive arrangement involves a main air shaft, 
with horizontal distribution along the corridors and 
branching ductwork directed outwards into the ceiling voids 
above rooms, to terminate directly behind the facade above 
the windows, or, at floor level, in the rooms above through 
holes in the floor structure. Max. office depth for high- 
pressure installations: 6m, beyond which air cooling 
requires an additional central conditioning system. Max. 
building depth without a central system: (2 x 6 =) 12m plus 
the corridor. Air can be removed through ducts over 
corridor wall storage cupboards or in ducting above the 
corridors and through WCs. In high-pressure systems, air is 
not recirculated (the air mass has already been reduced to 
that required for acceptable ventilation). For limited 
Operation, the primary air flow can be reduced in the plant 
room. 


Ventilation systems for kitchens 

For large kitchens (height 3-5m), render the upper sections 
(walls and ceilings) in porous plaster (no oil painting); 
provide 15-30 air changes, pressure below atmospheric, 
creating air flow from adjacent rooms into the kitchen; use 
larger radiators as appropriate; group boilers, cookers and 
fryers together; provide air extraction with a fat filter; clean 
ducting annually; filter and heat the air inlet flow in winter. 
No air circulation system is needed: local heating and 
insulating glazing are needed.

COLD STORAGE ROOMS 


To determine the cooling requirements for cold rooms, 
attention must be paid to the requirements of the commodities 
stored; humidity content, air changes, cooling or freezing 
duration, type of storage, etc. Also, consider the specific heat of 
the goods, internal environment, method of manufacture, 
position, heat from lighting and movements within the cold 
store. Calculation of the cooling requirement takes the 

following form (> pp. 111-16): 

(1) Cooling/refrigeration of the goods (cooling to the freezing 
point — freezing — supercooling) (O = m x cp x At); if goods are 
to be frozen solid, the necessary heat must be removed at the 
freezing point, and, subsequently, the specific heat of the 
frozen goods is lower; the humidity extraction is 
approximately 5% 

(2) Cooling and drying of the extracted air 

(3) Heating effects through walls, ceiling, floor 

(4) Losses: movements in and out of storage (door opening), 
natural and electric lighting, pump and ventilator operation 

(5) Condensation of water vapour on walls 

The cold storage of freshly slaughtered meat is cooled from 

303.15K to a temperature of 288.15K. This is achieved by placing 

it in a temperature of 280.15-281.15K at a relative humidity of 

85-90% in the pre-cooling room for 8-10 hours, and then storing 

it at 275.15K—-281.15K at a relative humidity of 75% for up to 28-30 

hours in the cool room. Cooling and storage takes place 

separately. Weight loss over 7 days is 4-5%. Today, rapid cooling 

is used increasingly, no pre-cooling stage, meat is cooled from a 

slaughter temp. of 303.15K to a storage temp. of 274.15K, with 

60-80 circulations of the air per hour and at a relative humidity of 

90-95%. 


Meat cooling and refrigeration 

The freezing process changes the condition and distribution of 
the water in meat, while the meat composition remains 
unchanged. 

Beef is frozen to 261.15K and pork to 258.15K, at a relative 
humidity of 90%. Duration of freezing: mutton, veal, pork, 2-4 
days; beef, hindquarters 4 days, forequarters, 3 days. Correct 
thawing period: 3-5 days to 278.15-281.15K, restores the meat 
to a fresh condition. 

Recently, mainly in the USA, rapid freezing methods have 
been employed, at temperatures of 248.15-243.15K, involving 
120-150 air circulations per hour. The advantages are: lower 
weight loss, increase in tenderness, replacement of the curing 
process, lower liquid loss, good consistency and preservability 
after thawing. 

Storage duration is dependent on the storage temperature; 
for example, for beef the storage duration is 15 months at 
255.15K, 4 months at 261.15K and 3 months at 263.65K. 

Cold room volume: 1m®% is suitable for the storage of 
400-500kg of mutton, 350-500kg of pork, 400-500kg of beef, 
with a standard stacking height of 2.5m. 


Refrigeration of fish 

Fresh fish can be maintained in this condition on ice at 272.15K 
and at a relative humidity of 90-100% for a period of 7 days. 
Longer storage times can be achieved through the use of 
bactericidal ice (calcium hypochlorite or caporite). For even 
longer storage, rapid freezing to 248.15 -233.15K is required, if 
necessary use glazing with fresh water to keep air out and 
prevent drying up. Fish crates are 90 x 50 x 34, giving a weight 
of approx. 150kg. 


Refrigeration of butter 

Butter refrigerated to 265.15K has a storage duration of 3-4 
months and a duration of 6-8 months at a temperature of 
258.15-252.15K. Lower temperatures can provide a period of up 
to 12 months. The relative humidity should be 85-90%. Butter 
drums are 600mm high with a diameter of 350-450mm, 
resulting in a weight of 50-60kg. 


Refrigeration of fruit and vegetables 

Immediate cooling is required, since a reduction of temperature 
to 281.15K delays ripening by 50%. Storage duration depends 
on air quality (temperature, relative humidity, movement), 
variety, maturity, soil quality, fertilising, climate, transportation, 
pre-cooling, etc.

Cooling of eggs 

Cold storage eggs are those stored in rooms whose 
temperature has been artificially controlled to a value lower 
than 8°C. Such eggs must be identified as ‘cold storage 
eggs’. To avoid sweating, if the temperature outside the 
cold storage room is more than 5°C greater than inside, the 
eggs must be warmed in a defrosting room with controlled 
air conditioning on removal from cold storage. The area of 
the defrosting room is approx.12% of that of the cold 
storage room. The warming-up time for quarter crates is 
approx. 10 hours; 18-24 hours for complete and half crates. 
Stacking of the quarter crates in the defrosting room: 
around 5000-6000 eggs (approx. 400kg gross) per m2. 
Crates of 500 eggs are 920mm long, 480mm wide and 
180mm high; for 122 dozen (= 1440) eggs, 1750 x 530 x 
250mm. A basis for calculation is 10-13 crates for 30 dozen, 
occupying 1m3 in the storage room; since one egg weighs 
50-60 grams, there is a weight of between 180-220kg of 
eggs in the 1m3. A net volume of 2.8m3 cold room capacity 
is required for 10,000 eggs. Two million eggs fill 15 freight 
wagons. For export, the eggs are packed in crates of 1440 
items; wood shavings are used as packing between the 
eggs, giving a gross weight of 80-105kg. For Egyptian eggs, 
this weight is 70-87kg, tare, i.e. the empty crate and 
shavings weigh 16-18kg. One wagon contains 100 half 
export crates holding 144,000 eggs or 400 ‘lost’ crates with 
360 items each. Standard crates for 360 eggs are 660mm 
long, 316mm wide and 361mm high (the so-called ‘lost’ 
crates). They can be divided into two by a central partition. 
Cardboard inserts are used. The crates are made from dry 
spruce; pine is unsuitable. Stacked 7 crates high, 
10,000-11,000 eggs can be stored on a net area of 1m2. Dry 
air, at 75% humidity and air-tight packaging is used, with 
cube-shaped crates with 360 eggs in each, in protective 
cardboard pockets. If the eggs are exposed to the ingress of 
air, the air humidity can be 83-85%. The air humidity in the 
store is controlled by first supercooling then heating it 
within the ventilation system. The weight loss during the 
first months in cold storage is severer than later months: a 
weight loss of 3-4.5% occurs after 7 months. Eggs can also 
be conserved in a gaseous atmosphere of 88% CO, and 12% 
N, after Lescardé-Everaert, in gas-filled autoclaves at 
around 0°C. This preserves the eggs in their natural state. 
Uniformity of temperature and air humidity are important 
factors. Ozone is frequently introduced into egg cold 
storage rooms. The cooling requirement during storage is 
3300-5000 kJ/day per m2 of floor surface — higher during the 
period when eggs are introduced. The storage periods run 
from Apr/May to Oct/Nov. 


Cooling and refrigeration of poultry and game 
Large game (red deer, roe deer, wild boar) must be drawn 
before freezing, but this is not necessary for small game 
(hare, rabbit, game birds). Freezing takes place before 
plucking, with the game free-hanging; storage being in 
stacks on gridded floor panels. There should be plenty of air 
movement during freezing, but little during storage. These 
numbers of game can be stored per square metre of floor 
area (3[t]lm high): approx. 100 hares, or 20 roe deer, or 7-10 
red deer. The air humidity should be approx. 85% at -12°C. 
Domestic poultry should not be frozen and stored with 
game, as the fat content of the former requires a lower 
temp. and is sensitive to the smell of game. The cooling of 
poultry takes place at 0°C and at 80-85% relative humidity, 
with the birds suspended on frames, or alternatively, in iced 
water; storage at O°C and 85% relative humidity, with a 
Storage duration of approx. 7 days. Freezing at approx. 
-30-—-35°C, storage at around -25°C and 85-90% relative 
humidity. The freezing time for a chicken is approx. 4 hours 
at an air velocity of 2-3m/sec. Deep freezing, using the 
cryovac method, takes place in vacuum latex bags. Young 
chickens will freeze through in 2-3 hours. Storage duration 
is approx. 8 months at ~-18°C. To prevent rancidity, the 
poultry is protected by wrapping in water vapour tight 
polyethylene film.

Room cooling, general 

From the viewpoint of reserves and safety, the cooling 
system is designed to have a higher performance than the 
calculated cooling requirement. It is assumed that the 
cooling system will operate for 16-20 hours per day in 
cooling and freezing rooms; in individual cases, e.g. for 
efficient utilisation of electrical tariffs, the period may be 
even shorter. In meat cold storage rooms, the cooling 
power should not be too high, so that during periods of 
reduced cooling requirements, adequate operating 
durations and the required throughput of air in the room 
will still be guaranteed. 

In small commercial cold storage rooms with a 
temperature of approx. 2-4°C and a product throughput of 
50 kg/m? per day, the following table serves as a reference 
to determine the cooling requirement and the requisite 
power of the cooling system.

THERMAL INSULATION 
Terminology and Mechanisms 


Thermal insulation should minimise heat loss (or gain) allowing 
energy savings to be made, provide a comfortable environment for 
occupants, and protect a building from damage that might be 
caused by sharp temperature fluctuations (in particular, 
condensation). Heat exchange ~ by thermal convection, conduction, 
radiation and water vapour diffusion — cannot be prevented, but its 
rate can be reduced by efficient thermal insulation. 


Terms used in calculating thermal insulation values 
Although temperature is often given in degrees Celsius (°C), kelvin 
(K) is also used (OK = -273.15°C). 

Quantity of heat is expressed in watt hours (Wh). (1Wh = 3.6kJ.) 

Thermal capacity, the heat necessary to raise the temperature of 
1kg of material by 1K, is a measure of the readiness to respond to 
internal heat or to changing external conditions. 1kcal (= 1.16Wh) is 
the heat required to increase the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1K. 

Thermal conductance (C-value), in W/m2K, measures the rate at 
which a given thickness of material allows heat conduction, based 
on temperature differences between hot and cold faces; no account 
is taken of surface resistance. Thermal conductivity (k-value or A 
specific to a given material), in W/mK (or kcal/mhK), measures the 
rate at which homogenous material conducts heat: the smaller the 
value, the lower the thermal conductivity. Thermal resistance (R- 
value = thickness/k), the reciprocal of thermal conductance (1/C), 
measures the resistance of material or structure with a particular 
thickness to heat transfer by conduction. Thermal resistivity (r- 
value), is the reciprocal of conductivity (1/k). 

UK thermal insulation standards have risen since 1990, under the 
new Building Regulations, in which the thermal insulation value is 
used to evaluate temperature variation in, and possibility of damage 
to, a structural component due to condensation. 

The thermal boundary layer resistance, 1/a, is the thermal 
resistance of the air ‘boundary’ layer on a structural component: 1/«, 
on the outside and 1/a; on the inside of the component. The lower 
the velocity of the air, the higher is the value of 1/a. Total resistance 
to heat flow =R is the sum of the resistances of a component against 
heat conductance: ER = 1/a, + 1/C + 1/a,. 

The coefficient of thermal transmittance (U-value) — like thermal 
conductance — measures the rate at which material of a particular 
thickness allows heat conduction, i.e. the heat loss, and thus provides 
a basis for heating calculations, but the calculation is based on 
temperature difference between ambient temperatures on either side: 
account Is taken of surface resistances of the structure. As the most 
important coefficient in calculating the level of thermal insulation, its 
value is specified in the Building Regulations, and is used by the 
heating systems manufacturer as a basis of measurement. 

The mean U-value of window (w) and wall (W) is calculated as 
Umiw + wy = (Uw x Fy + Uw Fy) = (Fy + Fy), F being the surface area. 
Similarly, U,,, the coefficient of a building cell is calculated from the 
F and U values of the components making up the cell — window (w), 
wall (W), ceiling (c), floor surface (f) and roof area in contact with air

THERMAL INSULATION 


Terminology and Mechanisms 


Thermal insulation should minimise heat loss (or gain) allowing 
energy savings to be made, provide a comfortable environment for 
occupants, and protect a building from damage that might be 
caused by sharp temperature fluctuations (in particular, 
condensation). Heat exchange — by thermal convection, conduction, 
radiation and water vapour diffusion — cannot be prevented, but its 
rate can be reduced by efficient thermal insulation. 


Terms used in calculating thermal insulation values 
Although temperature is often given in degrees Celsius (°C), kelvin 
(K) is also used (OK = -273.15°C). 

Quantity of heat is expressed in watt hours (Wh). (1Wh = 3.6kJ.) 

Thermal capacity, the heat necessary to raise the temperature of 
1kg of material by 1K, is a measure of the readiness to respond to 
internal heat or to changing external conditions. 1kcal (= 1.16Wh) is 
the heat required to increase the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1K. 

Thermal conductance (C-value), in W/m2K, measures the rate at 
which a given thickness of material allows heat conduction, based 
on temperature differences between hot and cold faces; no account 
is taken of surface resistance. Thermal conductivity (k-value or A 
specific to a given material), in W/mK (or kcal/mhK), measures the 
rate at which homogenous material conducts heat: the smaller the 
value, the lower the thermal conductivity. Thermal resistance (R- 
value = thickness/k), the reciprocal of thermal conductance (1/C), 
measures the resistance of material or structure with a particular 
thickness to heat transfer by conduction. Thermal resistivity (r- 
value), is the reciprocal of conductivity (1/k). 

UK thermal insulation standards have risen since 1990, under the 
new Building Regulations, in which the thermal insulation value is 
used to evaluate temperature variation in, and possibility of damage 
to, a structural component due to condensation. 

The thermal boundary layer resistance, 1/a, is the thermal 

LPS f{pSELwg] ponuUqsLA |SAGL LeelesguCcE’ J\@ 12 [HE fPELW9| 


Spr me tw OS OY UII 


The thermal boundary layer resistance, 1/a, is the thermal 
resistance of the air ‘boundary’ layer on a structural component: 1/a, 
on the outside and 1/a; on the inside of the component. The lower 
the velocity of the air, the higher is the value of 1/«. Total resistance 
to heat flow =R is the sum of the resistances of a component against 
heat conductance: ER = 1/a + 1/C + 1/a,. 

The coefficient of thermal transmittance (U-value) ~ like thermal 
conductance — measures the rate at which material of a particular 
thickness allows heat conduction, i.e. the heat loss, and thus provides 
a basis for heating calculations, but the calculation is based on 
temperature difference between ambient temperatures on either side; 
account is taken of surface resistances of the structure. As the most 
important coefficient in calculating the level of thermal insulation, its 
value is specified in the Building Regulations, and is used by the 
heating systems manufacturer as a basis of measurement. 

The mean U-value of window (w) and wall (W) is calculated as 
Uniw + w) = (Uy x Fy + Uw Fw) = (Fy + Fy), F being the surface area. 
Similarly, U,,,, the coefficient of a building cell is calculated from the 
F and U values of the components making up the cell — window (w), 
wall (W), ceiling (c), floor surface (f) and roof area in contact with air 
(r) — taking account of minimum factors for roof and ground areas: 
Un = Uy xFy + Uwx Fy + U,xF, + 0.8U.xF, + 0.5U; x F; 

Fw t+ Fw +, +F, + F, 
Heat transfer through a component: a quantity of heat is conducted 
through the internal air boundary layer and then the inner surface of 
the component; some of this heat overcomes the thermal insulation 
value of the component to reach the outer surface, overcomes the 
outer air boundary layer and reaches the outside air » (1). Changes 
in temperature through the individual layers are in proportion to the 
percentage each contributes to the resistance to heat flow =R_ > (3). 

Example: If 1/o; + 1/C +1/a, = 0.13 + 0.83 + 0.04 = 1.00, then 
Vo WC 1/0, = 13%:83%:4%. For a temperature difference of 40K 
between inside and outside, then: temperature difference across 
inner boundary layer = 13% of 40K = 5.2K: temperature across 
material = 83% of 40K = 33.2K; and temperature across outer 
boundary layer = 4% of 40K = 1.6K. 

The lower the thermal insulation of the component, the lower is 
the temperature of the inner surface of the component > (7), and the 
easier it is for condensation to occur. Since the temperature varies 
linearly through each individual layer, this appears as a straight line if 
the component is represented to scale in proportion to the thermal 
insulation of the individual layers »() - (6); the interrelationships are 
then more easily seen. The variation of temperature is particularly 
important in considering the expansion of the component due to heat, 
in addition to the question of condensation >» p. 112.

THERMAL INSULATION 
Types of Construction 


Construction without vapour barrier — (1) 

Conventional construction contains no vapour retarding layers. 
Layers should be provided so that no condensation occurs: for 
sufficient thermal insulation, the layer factor 4 should fall from 
inside to outside. In the case of very damp rooms (e.g. 
swimming pools), the vapour pressure variation should be 
checked either graphically or by calculation. 

Note: on the outside of thermal insulation layers with normal 
plastering, there is a danger of cracking due to the build up of 
heat and low shear strength of the base material; therefore, 
glass fibre reinforced finishing plaster should be applied (but 
not in the case of swimming pools — see pp. 242-3). 


Construction with vapour barrier » ©) 

In more recent building construction (‘warm roof’, ‘warm 
facade’), there is a vapour impermeable outside layer, resulting 
in the necessity for an internal vapour barrier ( » p. 112). On 
vertical components, this is difficult to accomplish; a better 
form of construction is to provide a rear-ventilated outer skin 
(except for prefabricated walls). Note: the thermal insulation, 
including the air boundary layer on the layers up to the 
condensation barrier, must not exceed a specific level of 
contribution to the resistance to heat (p. 112). In solid 
constructions, protection of the vapour barrier against 
mechanical damage can be achieved by means of a protective 
layer. Since no high pressure — in the sense of a steam boiler — 
occurs on the inside of the vapour barrier, only vapour 
pressure (> p. 112), the frequently recommended ‘pressure 
compensation’ provided by this layer, is not in fact required. 


Construction with rear ventilated outer skin > 5) 

Rear ventilation avoids the vapour barrier effect of relatively 
vapour tight outer layers. It works by exploiting height 
difference (min. fall 10% between air inlet and air outlet). If there 
is only a small difference, then a vapour-retarding layer or 
vapour barrier is required (arrangement —> construction with a 
vapour barrier), otherwise there will be excessive vapour 
transmission and condensation at the outer skin. The layering 
on the inner skin should be as for construction without a vapour 
barrier. However, the inner skin must always be airtight. 

Cold bridges are places in the structure with low thermal 
insulation relative to their surroundings. At these places, the 
contribution of the air boundary layer to the resistance flow to 
heat increases, such that the surface temperature of the inner 
surface of the cold bridge reduces and condensation can occur 
there. The increase in heating costs due to the cold bridge, on 
the other hand, is insignificant, so long as the cold bridge is 
relatively small; this is not the case, however, for single-glazed 
windows which, in reality, are also cold bridges > (7) p. 111. 

To avoid condensation on the surface of the component and 
its unwelcome consequences (mould growth, etc.), the 
temperature of the inner surface of the cold bridge must be 
increased. This can be achieved by either reducing the heat 
extraction through the cold bridge by means of an insulating 
layer against the ‘outer cold’ (increasing the thermal insulation 
reduces the percentage contribution of the air boundary layer to 
the resistance to heat flow =R), or increasing the heat input to 
the cold bridge by increasing the inner surface of the cold 
bridge, e.g. good conducting surroundings to the cold bridge, 
and/or blowing with warm air. This will result in an actual 
reduction in the inner surface resistance 1/0; in relation to the 
cold bridge and hence also the contribution of the air boundary 
layer to the resistance to heat flow =R. Typical examples are 
shown in (6). However, a normal outer corner ina building » ©), 
forms a cold bridge, since, at such a point, the opposite to that 
shown in Q) occurs; a large heat transmitting outer surface is in 
combination with a small heat inputting inner surface, so that 
the insulation of the air boundary layer in the corners is 
appreciably higher than that on the surface. 

For this reason, condensation and mould are often seen in 
the corners of walls with minimal thermal insulation.

SOUND INSULATION 


Even if propagation of sound is avoided, complete elimination of a 
noise is impossible. If the sound source and the hearer are located 
in the same room, then some reduction takes place through sound 
absorptivity > p. 120. If they are in separate rooms, then sound 
insulation is the main remedy. 

A distinction is made between sound insulation of airborne 
sound and sound insulation of structure-borne sound: airborne 
sound sources initially disturb the surrounding air, e.g. radio, 
shouting or loud music; with structure-borne sound, the sound 
source is propagated directly through a structure, e.g. Movement of 
people on foot, noise from plant and machinery. Sound from a piano 
is an example of both airborne sound and structure-borne sound. 

Sound is propagated by mechanical vibration and pressure waves 
- very small increases and decreases in pressure relative to 
atmospheric pressure of the order of a few microbars (ub). (The 
pressure fluctuation generated by speaking in a loud voice is about one 
millionth of atmospheric pressure.) Sounds and vibrations audible to 
humans lie in the frequency range 20Hz-20000Hz (1Hz = 1 cycle per 
second). However, as far as construction is concerned, the significant 
range is 100-3200 Hz, to which the human ear is particularly sensitive. 
In the human audible range, sound pressures extend from the hearing 
threshold to the pain threshold -> (1). This hearing range is divided into 
12 parts, called bels (after A. G. Bell, inventor of the telephone). Since 
0.1 bel (or 1 decibel = 1dB) is the smallest difference in sound pressure 
perceptible to the human ear at the normal frequency of 1000Hz, 
decibels are a physical measure of the intensity of sound, related to 
unit surface area -» (1). Usually, noise levels of up to 60dB are 
expressed in dB(A); those of more than 60dB in dB(B), a unit which is 
approximately equivalent to the former unit, the phon. 

For airborne sound, the sound level difference (between the 
Original sound level and the insulated sound level) serves to indicate 
the degree of sound insulation. For body-propagated sound, a 
maximum level is given, which must remain from a standard noise 
level. Sound insulation, principally due to mass, is provided by the 
use of heavy, thick components in which the airborne sound energy 
is initially dissipated through transfer of the airborne sound into the 
component, then through excitation of the mass of the component 
itself and then, finally, by transfer back into the air. If the component 
is directly excited (body sound), then its insulation is naturally lower. 

Light sound-damping construction > (6) makes use of multiple 
transfer (air to component to air to component to air) in providing 
sound insulation; better insulation, relative to that expected due to 
component mass, only occurs above the resonant frequency, 
however, which consequently should be below 100Hz. (This is 
comparable to the resonant frequency of the oscillation of a 
swinging door which is already swinging due to light impacts. It is 
simple to slow the motion of the door by braking; to make it move 
more quickly is more difficult and requires force.) The intermediate 
space in double-shell construction is filled with sound-absorbing 
material, to avoid reflection of the sound backwards and forwards. 
The sound propagates in the air as a longitudinal wave > (3), but as 
a transverse wave in solid materials. The speed of propagation of 
longitudinal waves is 340 m/sec but, within materials, this depends 
on the type of material, layer thickness and frequency. The 
frequency at which the velocity of propagation of a transverse wave 
in a structural component is 340m/sec, is called the boundary 
frequency. At this frequency, the transfer of sound from the air into 
the component and vice versa, is very good; therefore, the sound 
insulation of the component is particularly poor, poorer than would 
be expected from the weight of the wall. For heavy, quite inflexible 
building components, the boundary frequency is close to the 
frequency range of interest and therefore exhibits reduced sound 
insulation properties; for thin, flexible components, the boundary 
frequency is below this frequency range > (5).

SOUND INSULATION 


With airborne sound, the aerial sound wave excites the component 
+ (1); hence, the effect of the boundary frequency on the sound 
insulation increases —> (5). 

The standard curve shows how large the sound level difference 
must be at the individual frequencies, as a minimum, so as to 
achieve a level of sound insulation of +0dB. Prescribed values — (2); 
required wall thicknesses —> (7). 

However, the effect of sound transmitted by ‘secondary paths’ 
(e.g. sound from foot steps) can be more disruptive than that from 
impact, so these must be taken into account in the sound insulation 
calculations. (For this reason, test results should always be drawn 
up for sound insulating walls with due consideration of the usual 
secondary paths.) Components which are stiff in bending, with 
weights per unit surface area of 10-160kg/m2, are particularly likely 
to provide secondary paths. Therefore, living room dividing walls — 
which are contacted by such components in the form of lateral walls 
~ should have a weight of at least 400kg/m2. (Where the contacting 
walls have a surface weight of over 250kg/m2, this value can be 
350 kg/m2.) 

Doors and windows, with their low sound insulation properties 
+ ©), have a particularly adverse effect on insulation against 
airborne sound; the small proportion of the surface occupied by the 
openings is usually subject to a sound insulation value which ts less 
than the arithmetic mean of the sound damping of wall and opening. 
Therefore, the sound insulation of the door or window should 
always be improved where possible. Walls which have insufficient 
sound insulation can be improved through the addition of a non- 
rigid facing panel > 6) p. 117. Double walls can be particularly well 
soundproofed if they contain soft, springy insulating material and 
are relatively flexible + (©) p. 117, or if the two wall panels are 
completely separately supported. Flexible panels are relatively 
insensitive to small sound bridges (by contrast to rigid panels). Type 
testing methods of construction should always be employed on 
sound insulating double walls. Covering layers of plaster on 
insulation materials of standard hardness (e.g. on standard 
styrofoam) considerably reduces the sound insulation.

SOUND INSULATION 


House dividing walls 

House dividing walls constructed from wall leafs with leaf 
weights per unit surface area < 350 kg/m? must be separated 
by a cavity over the entire depth of the house: their mass 
should be >150kg/m2 (200 kg/m2 in multi-storey residences). 
If the dividing wall commences at the foundations, no 
additional precautions are necessary; if it commences at the 
ground level (as for dividing walls between separate 
residential accommodation), the floor above the cellar must 
have a suspended floor or a soft springy covering. The 
cavity should be provided with filling material (foam panels, 
etc.) preferably with staggered joints; small jointing areas 
can reduce the sound insulation, because the structure is 
resistant to bending. 


Composite walls 

In this case (including any walls with areas of different 
sound insulation properties, e.g. with a door), the total 
insulation value Dg is obtained after deducting the insulation 
reduction R from the overall insulation value = @.

Impact sound insulation 

In the case of impact sound (e.g. noise due to footsteps), the 
ceiling is directly excited into vibration = @. The standard 
Curve > @) gives a standardised impact sound level, i.e., the 
maximum that should be heard in the room below when a 
standard ‘tramper’ is in action above. To allow for ageing, 
the values achieved immediately after construction must be 
3dB better than the values shown. 

The usual form of impact sound insulation is provided by 
‘floating’ screed, i.e. a jointless, soft, springy insulating 
layer, covered with a protective layer and, then, a screed of 
cement concrete, anhydrous gypsum or poured asphalt. 
This simultaneously provides protection against airborne 
sound and is therefore suitable for all types of floors (floor 
groups | and Il). The edge should be free to move, and 
mastic joint filler with enduring elasticity should always be 
used, particularly with tiled floors —. (%, since the screed is 
thin and stiff, and is therefore extremely sensitive to sound 
bridges. With floors whose airborne sound insulation is 
already adequate (floor group II), impact insulation can also 
be provided by using a soft, springy floor finish + @. Floors 
in floor group | can be upgraded to group II by the provision 
of a soft, springy suspended floor — 4). The degree to which 
this floor finish improves the impact sound insulation is 
judged from the improvement in dB attenuation.

Noise from services 
Noise from services can occur as plumbing fixture noise, pipework 
noise and/or filling/emptying noises: 
¢ For plumbing fixture noise, the remedy is provided by sound- 
insulated valves with inspection symbols (test group | with at 
most 20dB(A) overall noise level, test group II with at most 
30dB(A) only permissible for internal house walls and 
adjoining service rooms). All installations are improved, 
among other measures, by sound dampers. 
¢ For pipework noise due to the formation of vortices in the 
pipework, the remedy is to use radiused fittings instead of 
sharp angles, adequate dimensioning, and sound damping 
suspensions - (1). 

© For filling noise caused by water on the wails of baths, etc. 
the remedy is to muffle the objects, fit aerator spouts on the 
taps, and to sit baths on sound damping feet (and use elastic 
joints around the edges). 

e For emptying noise (gurgling noises), the remedy is correct 

dimensioning and ventilation of drain pipes. 
The maximum permissible sound level due to services in adjoining 
accommodation is 35dB(A). Sound generating components of 
domestic services and machinery (e.g. water pipes, drain pipes, gas 
supply pipes, waste discharge pipes, lifts) must not be installed in 
rooms intended for quiet everyday activities (e.g. living rooms, 
bedrooms). 

Sound insulation for boilers can be effected by sound-damped 
installation (isolated foundation > (@), sound-absorbing sub- 
construction), sound-damping hood for the burner, connection to 
chimney with sound-damping entry, and connection to hot pipework 
by means of rubber compensators. 

In ventilation ducts of air conditioning systems, noise from 
sound transmission is reduced by means of so-called telephonic 
sound dampers; these comprise sound-absorbing packings, 
between which the air flows. The thicker the packing, the lower the 
frequencies which are covered. The ventilation ducts themselves 
should also be sound insulated.

Sound absorption 
fe : In contrast to sound insulation, sound absorption does not usually 

f Fereeeseee : reduce the passage of sound through a component. It has no effect 

eae on the sound which reaches the ear directly from the source; it 
: merely reduces the reflected sound. 
7] UnEEeeREeE eeeeeete] FRSEEEEEE Although the direct sound diminishes with distance from the 
400 600 800 source, the reflected sound is just as loud, or louder than the direct 
sound, at a distance greater than the ‘sound’ radius about the sound 
source > (5). If the reflection of sound is reduced, then the level of 
the reflected sound is reduced outside the original ‘sound’ radius, 
while the sound radius itself increases. Nothing changes within the 
Original sound radius. 

The sound absorption capability of a room is expressed in m2 
equivalent sound absorption, i.e. the ideal sound absorbing surface 
that has the same absorption capability as the room itself. For a 
reverberation time of 1.5 sec. — ideal for private swimming baths, 
etc. — the equivalent sound absorption surface A must be 0.1m2 for 
every m3 of room volume v (the sound radius would then be only 
1.1m in a room 6 x 10 x 2.5m) and twice as large to achieve half the 
reverberation time.

A= ae = 0.2V; reverberation time is thus 0.75 seconds. 


Protection against external noise 
Precautions can be taken against external noise (traffic, etc.): 
¢ Appropriate planning of the building, e.g. living/recreation 
rooms away from sources of noise 
® Sound insulation of outer walls, particularly window and 
outer door insulation; fixed glazed installations with 
ventilation systems 
Installation of sound insulation shields in facades 
Sound protection through landscaping, e.g. embankments, 
walls or planted areas 
In the case of embankments, walls and other screens, the sizing of 
the protective device can be obtained > ( for the various 
wavelengths (wavelength is approx. 340 m/frequency). It can be seen

VIBRATION DAMPING 


Sound Conduction Through Structures 


Vibrations in solid bodies, ‘structure-borne sounds’, are 
created either by sound in air, or directly, by mechanical 
excitation > @)+ ©. 

Since the alternating mechanical forces are usually 
higher than any produced by fluctuating air pressure, the 
audible radiation is usually greater in the case of direct 
excitation. Frequently, resonance phenomena occur, which 
lead to higher audible radiation in narrow frequency ranges. 

If the radiated sound remains monotonic, the cause is 
usually the result of direct excitation of the structure. Anti 
‘structure-borne sound’ measures must therefore seek to 
reduce this direct excitation and its further propagation. 


Precautions to combat structure-borne sound transmission 
In the case of water installations, only valves carrying 
inspection symbols in accordance with group | or Il should 
be used. The water pressure should be as low as possible. 

The water velocity plays a subordinate role. 

Pipework should be attached to walls in accordance with 
good practice, with surface loading m” > 250kg/m2. 

Baths and tanks should be installed on floating screed 
and separated from walls. Walled enclosures should be 
flexibly jointed to the primary walls. Wall-suspended WC 
fittings cause direct excitation of the structure; however, 
rigid fixing is unavoidable, so if necessary, elastic layers 
should be introduced. 

Water and drainage pipes must be fixed using elastic 
materials and should not be in direct contact with the 
structural wall. 

Lifts should be installed in separate shafts — @) and joints 
filled with at least 30mm mineral fibre, or the top of the 
shaft provided with Neoprene bearing strips > @). 

Pumps and equipment must be installed on structure- 
borne sound insulated foundations and _ elastically 
connected. 

Compensators are subject to tensile stresses, since the 
internal pressure also acts on the longitudinal axis of the 
assembly => (6). 

Rubber granulate panels are particularly suitable as 
insulating material for foundations, due to their high 
compressive strength. If required, impact sound insulating 
materials of mineral fibre and plastic foam can be built in. 
Cork and solid rubber are unsuitable, since these materials 
are too stiff. The more the insulating materials are 
compressed together under load, without being 
overloaded, the better is the insulating effect. 

With flat insulating materials, the loading must usually 
be greater than 0.5N/mm2. If this cannot be guaranteed, 
then individual elements are required, effectively to add to 
the weight of the equipment. 

The insulating effect is also greatest here if the elements 
are loaded to a maximum, without becoming overloaded. 
The individual elements can be of Neoprene or steel | ©). 

Steel springs provide the best structural sound 
insulation, due to their low stiffness. In special cases, air 
springs can be used. In the case of individual springs, 
attention must be paid to the centre of gravity, to ensure the 
elements are uniformly loaded - (7%). 

In the case of periodic excitation (e.g. due to oscillating 
or rotating masses), the frequency of excitation must not 
coincide with the natural frequency of the elastically 
suspended system. Large motions result from the 
reverberation which, in the case of elements with low 
damping, can lead to structural failure -» (8). Particularly 
high insulating properties may be obtained by using 
doubled elastic suspensions » Q). Unfavourable interaction 
between foundations on floating layers can lead to a 
reduction in insulation.

ROOM ACOUSTICS 


Room acoustic planning should ensure that optimum 
audible conditions are created for listeners in rooms where 
speech and music are to be carried out. Various factors 
should be considered, of which the two most important are 
reverberation time, and reflections (as a consequence of the 
primary and secondary structure of the room). 


(1) Reverberation time 
This is the time taken for the decay of a noise level of 
60 dB after the sound source has been switched off; (1. 
Evaluation is carried out over the range —5 to -35aB. 


(2) Absorption surface 
The absorption surface is determined by the amount of 
absorbing material, expressed as an area having 
complete absorption (open window): 
A=02%5 
where a, is the degree of sound absorption from echo 
chamber measurements, and S is the area of surface 
portion. 
The reverberation time is calculated from the absorption 
surface from: 
t = 0.163 x V+ a, x S (after Sabine) 


(3) Echoes 
When individual, subjectively recognisable peaks are 
superimposed on a smoothly falling reverberation time 
curve > (1), these are described as echoes — @). Various 
values of time and intensity apply as the echo criterion 
for speech and music. Rooms devoted to music should 
have a longer reverberation time, but are usually 
regarded as less critical from the point of view of echoes. 


Requirements for rooms 

(1) Reverberation time 
The optimum value for reverberation time is dependent 
on the particular use and room volume > @). In general, 
reverberation time is frequency-dependent (longer at 
low frequencies, shorter at high frequencies.) For f = 
900Hz, surveys have shown that approximations may 
provide optimum values > @. 


(2) Speech intelligibility 
This is used to judge the degree of audibility of the 
spoken word — (©). It is not standardised, so various 
terms - sentence intelligibility, syllable intelligibility, 
evaluation with logatomes —- are usual. In determining 
the intelligibility of speech, a number of collectively 
heard individual syllables of no significance (logatomes 
such as lin and ter) are noted; the correctness is used to 
make an assessment — a score of more than 70% implies 
excellent speech intelligibility. Newer, objective, 
methods make use of modulated noise signals (RASTI 
method) and lead to reproducible results at low expense. 


(3) Impression of space 

This is determined by the reception of reflections with 
respect to time and direction. For music, diffuse 
reflections are favourable for sound volume, while early 
reflections with delays of up to 80ms (corresponding to 
27m path difference) with respect to the direct sound 
promote clarity — ©). Speech requires shorter delays (up 
to 50ms) so as not to degrade the intelligibility.

ROOM ACOUSTICS 


For the music listener, early sideways reflections are better 
than ceiling reflections, even at very low delay times 
(asymmetry of the acoustic impression), since each ear 
receives a different signal. Narrow, high rooms with 
geometrically reflecting walls with multiple angles and 
diffusely reflecting ceilings are the simplest from the point 
of view of room acoustics. 


Primary structure of rooms 
Volume is application dependent — 6) p. 122: 4m3/person 
for speech, 18m3/person for concerts; too small a volume 
results in insufficient reverberation time. Narrow, high 
rooms with walls with multiple angles (early sideways 
reflections) are particularly suitable for music. For early 
initial reflections and balance of the orchestra, reflection 
surfaces are needed in the vicinity of the podium. The rear 
wall of the room should not cause any reflections in the 
direction of the podium, since these can have the effect of 
echoes. Parallel, planar surfaces should be avoided, to 
prevent directionally oscillating echoes due to multiple 
reflections > (1). Providing projections in the walls, at angles 
greater than 5°, avoids parallel surfaces and allows diffuse 
reflection to occur. The ceiling serves to conduct the sound 
into the back part of the room and must be shaped 
accordingly => (). If the ceiling shape is unfavourable, large 
differences in sound intensity occur due to sound 
concentrations. Rooms where the walls are further apart at 
the back than at the front of the room produce unfavourable 
effects, since the reflections from the sides can be too weak 
—+ @) this disadvantage can be compensated by the using 
additional reflection surfaces (Weinberg steps) — as in the 
Berlin and Cologne Philharmonics — (6) - or the walls may 
be provided with pronounced folding to guide the sound. 
Wherever possible, the podium should be on the narrow 
side of the room; in the case of the spoken word or in small 
rooms (chamber music), it may even be arranged on a long 
wall (Beethoven Archive > ©)). Multipurpose rooms with 
variably arranged podia and plain parquet floors are 
frequently problematic for music. The podium must be 
raised in relation to the parquet, so as to support the direct 
propagation of the sound; otherwise, the level of the sound 
propagation would fall too quickly > @). Providing an 
upward inclination of the seating levels, to obtain a uniform 
level of direct sound at all seats gives better visibility and 
acoustics — (7); the slope of the seating levels should follow 
a logarithmic curve. 


Secondary structure 

Reflection surfaces can compensate for an unfavourable 
primary structure: projections on the surface of walls which 
diverge, ceiling shapes produced by hanging sails or the 
use of individual elements > p. 124.

Building regulations require that due consideration must be 
given in buildings to: 

~ the flammability of building materials 

— the duration of fire resistance of the components 

expressed in terms of fire resistance classifications 

- the integrity of the sealing of openings 

— the arrangement of escape routes. 
The aim is to prevent the start and spread of a fire, stem the 
spread of smoke and facilitate the escape or rescue of 
persons and animals. In addition consideration must be 
given to effective extinguishing of a fire. Active and passive 
precautions must be taken to satisfy these requirements. 
Active precautions are those systems that are automatically 
deployed in the event of fire; passive precautions are the 
construction solutions in the building and its components. 

Active precautions include smoke and fire alarm systems, 
sprinkler systems, water spray extinguisher plant, CO, 
extinguishing installations, powder and foam extinguisher 
plant, and automatic smoke and heat venting systems. 
Passive precautions relate mainly to minimum structural 
sections, casings and coatings. In addition to these, other 
important measures are the layout of rising mains, 
installation of fire doors and fire windows, construction of 
supporting floors, water cooling of hollow steel profiles and 
the dimensioning of casings and coatings for steel profiles. 


Fire detectors 
A fire detector is a part of the fire alarm system and can 
trigger a transmitting device that raises the alarm in a 
remote control centre. There are automatic and non- 
automatic fire detectors. The latter are those which can be 
activated manually. Automatic fire detectors are parts of the 
overall fire alarm system that sense changes in specific 
physical and/or chemical parameters (either continuously 
or sequentially in set time intervals) to detect a fire within 
the monitored area. They must be: 
— installed in sufficient numbers and be suited to the 
general arrangement of the area to be monitored 
— selected according to the fire risk 
— mounted in such a way that whatever parameter change 
triggers the alarm can be easily sensed by the detector. 


Typical applications for different types of fire detectors 
(1) Smoke detectors 

These are used in rooms containing materials that would 
give off large volumes of smoke in the event of a fire. 

-— Optical smoke detectors: triggered by visible smoke. 

— lonisation smoke detectors: triggered by small 
amounts of smoke which have not been detected by 
optical means. These detectors provide earlier 
warning than optical smoke detectors and are 
suitable for houses, offices, storage and sales rooms. 

(2) Flame detectors 

These are activated by radiation emanating from flames 
and are used in rooms containing materials that burn 
without smoke, or produce very little. 

(3) Heat detectors 

These are useful for rooms in which smoke that could 
wrongly set off other early warning systems is generated 
under normal working conditions (e.g. in workshops where 
welding work is carried out). 

- Maximum detectors: triggered when a maximum 
temperature is exceeded (e.g. 70°C). 

— Differential detectors: triggered by a specified rise in 
temperature within a fixed period of time (e.g. a rise 
of 5°C in 1 minute). 

Tne planning and installation of fire detection systems must 
be designed to suit the area to be monitored, room height 
and the type of ceiling and roofing. 





FIRE DETECTION 


Typical extracts from building regulations and 
guidelines produced by fire and insurance specialists 
Fire development If the initial phase of a fire is likely to be 
of a type characterised by smouldering (i.e. considerable 
smoke generation, very little heat and little or no flame 
propagation), then smoke detectors should be used. If 
rapid development of fire is anticipated in the initial phase 
(severe heat generation, strong flame propagation and 
smoke development), then smoke, heat and flame 
detectors can be used, or combinations of the various 
types. 


Fire detection areas The total area to be monitored must be 
divided into detection areas. The establishment of these 
detection areas should be carried out in such a way that 
rapid and decisive pinpointing of the source of the fire is 
possible. A detection area must only extend over one floor 
level (the exceptions to this being stairwells, ventilation and 
elevator shafts and tower type structures, which must have 
their own detection areas). A detection area must not 
overlap into another fire compartment and typically should 
not be larger than 1600 m2. 


Fire detection systems for data processing facilities The 
monitoring of electronic data processing facilities places 
special additional requirements on the planning and 
execution of fire alarm systems. 


Factors influencing detector positions and numbers 
(1) Room height 

The greater the distance between the fire source and the 
ceiling, the greater the zone of evenly distributed smoke 
concentration will be. The ceiling height effects the 
suitability of the various types of smoke and fire detectors. 
Generally, higher ceiling sections whose area is less than 
10% of the total ceiling area are not considered, so long as 
these sections of ceiling are not greater in area than the 
maximum monitoring area of a detector. 

(2) Monitoring areas and distribution of the detectors 

The number of fire detectors should be selected such that 
the recommended maximum monitoring areas for each 
detector are not exceeded. Some standards specify the 
maximum distance between detectors and the maximum 
distance allowed between any point on the ceiling and the 
nearest detector. Within certain limits there may be a 
departure from the ideal square grid pattern of the 
detectors. 

(3) Arrangement of detectors on ceilings with downstanding 
beams 

Depending on the room size, beams above a specified 
depth must be taken into account in the arrangement of the 
fire detectors. Typically, if the area of ceiling between the 
downstanding beams is equal to or greater than 0.6 of the 
permissible monitoring area of the detector, then each of 
these soffit areas must be fitted with detectors. If the 
portions of soffit area are larger than the permissible 
monitoring area, then the individual portions of soffit must 
be considered as individual rooms. If the depth of the 
downstanding beam is greater than 800mm, then a fire 
detector must be provided for each soffit area. 

(4) For spaces with multi-bay type roofs 

Generally in this case, each bay must be provided with a 
row of detectors. Heat detectors are always to be fitted 
directly to the ceiling. In the case of smoke detectors, the 
distances required between the detector and the ceiling, or 
the roof, depend on the structure of the ceiling or roof and 
on the height of the rooms to be monitored. In the case of 
flame detectors, the distances should be determined for 
each individual case.

Internal fire spread (surface) 
The linings of walls and ceilings can be an important factor 
in the spread of a fire and its gaining hold. This can be 
particularly dangerous in circulation areas, where it might 
prevent people escaping. Two factors relating to the 
property of materials need to be taken into account: the 
resistance to flame spread over the surface and the rate of 
heat release once ignited. Various testing methods are used 
to establish these qualities. In the UK, a numbered system 
categorises the levels of surface flame spread and 
combustibility: 0, with the highest performance (non- 
combustible throughout), followed by classes 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
There are a series of standards that must be complied 
with relating to allowable class of linings in various 
locations. For example, for small rooms in residential 
buildings (4m2) and non-residential buildings (30m2), class 
3 materials are acceptable; for other rooms and circulation 
spaces within dwellings, use class 1 materials; and for busy 
public circulation spaces, class 0 materials should be used. 
Rooflights and lighting diffusers that form an integral part 
of the ceiling should be considered a part of the linings. 
There are limitations on the use of class 3 plastic roof-lights 
and diffusers. 


Internal fire spread (structure) 
There are three factors to be considered under this heading: 


(1) Fire resistance and structural stability 

It is necessary to protect the structure of a building from the 
effects of fire in order to allow people to escape, to make it 
safe for firefighters to enter the building to rescue victims 
and tackle the fire, and also to protect nearby people and 
adjacent buildings from the effects of a collapse. The level 
of fire resistance required depends on a range of factors: an 
estimation of the potential fire severity (depending on the 
use and content of the building); the height of the building; 
type of building occupancy; the number of floors and the 
presence of basements. Fire resistance has three aspects: 
resistance to collapse, resistance to fire penetration and 
resistance to heat penetration. Building regulations provide 
tables that set out specific provisions and minimum 
requirements of these aspects for different structural 
elements in different classes of buildings. 


(2) Compartmentation within buildings 

It is often necessary to divide a large complicated building 
into separate fire-resisting compartments in order to 
prevent the rapid spread of fire throughout the building. 
The factors to be considered are the same as those for fire 
resistance. Regulations stipulate maximum sizes of 
compartments for different building types. In general, floors 
in multistorey buildings form a compartment division, as do 
walls that divide different parts of multi-use buildings. The 
use of sprinklers can allow an increase in the compartment 
size in non-residential buildings. 

Careful attention should be paid to construction details 
of compartment walls and floors, particularly the junction 
details between walls, floors and roofs, such that the 
integrity of fire resistance is maintained. Strict rules apply 
to Openings permitted in compartment walls and floors, 
these being restricted to automatic self-closing doors with 
the appropriate fire resistance, shafts and chutes with the 
requisite non-combustible properties and openings for 
pipes and services, carefully sealed to prevent fire spread. 

There is a wide range of constructions, each of which 
offers a specific duration of resistance. For example, a floor 
of 21mm of tongue and groove timber boards (or sheets) 
on 37mm wide joists with a ceiling of 12.5mm plasterboard 
with joints taped and filled, will provide 30 minutes of fire 
resistance. For 60 minutes’ resistance the joists need to be 
50mm wide and the ceiling plasterboard 30mm with joints 


FIRE SPREAD 


staggered. This period is also achieved with a 95mm thick 
reinforced concrete floor, as long as the lowest 
reinforcement has at least 20mm cover. 

An internal load-bearing wall fire resistance of 30 
minutes can be achieved by a timber stud wall with 44mm 
wide studs at 600mm centres, boarded both sides with 
12.5mm plasterboard with joints taped and filled. The same 
will be achieved by a 100mm reinforced concrete wall with 
24mm cover to the reinforcement. A resistance of 60 
minutes is achieved by doubling the thickness of 
plasterboard on the stud wall to 25mm, and increasing the 
thickness of the concrete wall to 120mm. A 90mm thick 
masonry wall will achieve the same 60 minutes resistance 
(only 75mm is required for non-loadbearing partitions). 


(3) Fire and smoke in concealed spaces 

With modern construction methods there can be many 
hidden voids and cavities within the walls, floors and roofs. 
These can provide a route along which fire can spread 
rapidly, sometimes even bypassing compartment walls and 
floors. This unseen spread of fire and smoke is a particularly 
dangerous hazard. Steps must therefore be taken to break 
down large or extensive cavities into smaller ones and to 
provide ‘cavity barriers’, fire-resistant barriers across 
cavities at Compartment divisions. 

Regulations stipulate the maximum permitted dimensions 
for cavities depending on the location of the cavity and the 
class of exposed surface within it. Further stipulations dictate 
where cavity barriers must be installed (e.g. within roof 
spaces, above corridors and within walls). Generally the 
minimum standard of fire resistance of cavity barriers should 
be 30 minutes with regard to integrity and 15 minutes with 
regard to insulation. Fire stops must also be considered. 
These are seals that prevent fire spreading through cracks at 
junctions between materials that are required to act as a 
barrier to fire, and seals around perforations made for the 
passage of pipes, conduits, cables etc. 


External fire spread 

The spread of fire from one building to another is prevented 
by the fire resistant qualities of external walls and roofs. 
They must provide a barrier to fire and resist the surface 
spread of flame. The distance between buildings (or 
between the building and the boundary) is obviously an 
important factor, as is the likely severity of the fire, which is 
determined by the fire load of a building (i.e. the amount of 
combustible material contained within). Regulations 
therefore stipulate the required fire resistant qualities of 
external walls and the proportion and size of allowable 
unprotected areas (e.g. windows, doors, combustible 
cladding, etc.) depending on the type of building and the 
distance of the facade from the boundary. 

For example, the facade of a residential, office, assembly 
or recreation building at a distance of 1m from the 
boundary is allowed only 8% of unprotected area; at 5m, 
40%; and at 12.5m, 100%. In contrast, the figures for shops, 
commercial, industrial and storage buildings are: at 1m, 
4%; at 5m, 20%; and at 12.5m 50%; and only at 25m, 100%. 
More complex calculations are required when the facade is 
not parallel with the boundary, or is not flat. 

Generally, roofs do not need to be resistant to fire from 
inside the building, but should be resistant to fire from 
outside, and also resist surface flame spread. Again, the type 
of roof construction permitted depends on the type of 
building, its size and its distance from the boundary. 
Different roof coverings are rated as to their resistance to 
fire: on pitched roofs; slates, tiles, profiled metal sheet are in 
the highest category, bitumen strip slates in the lowest. 
Sheet metal flat roof coverings perform the best, whilst the 
performance of various bitumen felt roof coverings depend 
on the types of layers, underlayers and supporting structure. 


Smoke and heat venting systems 

Smoke and heat venting systems comprise one or more of 
the following elements, together with the associated 
activation and control devices, power supplies and 
accessories: 

— smoke vents 

— heat vents 

— mechanical smoke extractors. 

Given that they have the task of removing smoke and heat 
in the event of fire, these systems contribute to: 

— preserving escape and access routes 

— facilitating the work of the firefighters 

- the prevention of flash-over, hence retarding or 

avoiding a full fire 

— the protection of equipment 

— the reduction of fire damage caused by burning gases 

and hot ash 

— reducing the risk of fire encroaching on structural 

elements. 
The main function of smoke venting is to create and 
maintain smoke-free zones in which people and animals 
can escape from a fire. These zones also ensure firefighters 
are unimpeded by smoke when tackling the fire and give 
the contents better protection from damage. In addition, 
smoke vents contribute to heat venting. 

The task of heat vents is to conduct away hot burning 
gases during the development of a fire. There are two main 
intentions: 

— to delay or retard the flash-over 

— to reduce the risk of the fire encroaching on structural 

elements. 
In the same way as smoke vents contribute to heat venting, 
heat vents contribute to smoke venting. 

The working principle of smoke and heat venting 
systems lies in the property of hot gases to rise. The 
effectiveness of the system depends on: 

- the aerodynamic efficiency of the air venting 

— the effect of wind 

— the size of the air vents 

~ the activation of air vents 

— the location of the installation relative to the general 

arrangement and size of the building. 


Mechanical smoke extractors 
Mechanical smoke extractors perform the same task as 
smoke vents but use forced ventilation (e.g. fans) to achieve 
the extraction of smoke. These smoke extractors are 
particularly useful where smoke vents are neither 
appropriate nor feasible for technical reasons. 

Appropriately sized smoke vents or mechanical smoke 
extractors can, in principle, be used in the place of heat 
vents. 

In view of their function and how they work, mechanical 
smoke extractors should be provided: 

- for single storey buildings with very large areas and 

volumes

means

which special protection is necessary 

— for buildings housing particularly valuable articles or 
equipment, or materials that are susceptible to smoke 
damage and therefore require extra protection. 





SMOKE AND HEAT EXTRACTION 
SYSTEMS 


Arrangement and sizing of smoke and heat vents 
Smoke and heat vents should be arranged as uniformly as 
possible within the roof sections. Special attention should 
be given to ensuring that, in the event of fire, the smoke and 
heat vents do not increase the danger of the fire spreading 
from building to building, or jumping between fire 
compartments within the building. In this respect, the 
boundary wall should be considered as a fire wall, for which 
there are increased requirements. 

To conduct the smoke and combustion gases directly to 
the outside, it is more effective to have a large number of 
smoke and heat vents with small openings than to provide 
a smaller number with larger openings. Typically, the 
spacing between smoke and heat vents and the distance 
from the lower edge of the structure (eaves) should not be 
greater than 20m and not less than the minimum distance 
from the walls, which is 5m. The distance of smoke and 
heat vent openings from structures on the surface of the 
roof must be large enough to ensure that their operation is 
not impaired by wind effects. 

A possible increase in wind loading should be noted 
when smoke and heat vents are located at the perimeter of 
flat roofs. 

As a general guideline, in roofs having a slope of from 
12° to 30°, the smoke and heat vents should be arranged as 
high as possible and there must be a minimum of one 
smoke and heat vent per 400m2 of plan surface area 
(projected roof area). For roof slopes >30°, the required 
efficiency of the smoke and heat venting should be 
considered on an individual project basis. In roof areas with 
a slope of <12°, one smoke and heat vent should serve not 
more than 200m2. Where, due to the building structure, 
there are further subdivisions of the roof, there must be a 
minimum of one smoke and heat vent per subdivision. 


Smoke and heat venting system efficiency 

To ensure the smoke and heat venting system operates at 
full aerodynamic efficiency, care must be taken to ensure 
that there is an adequate volume of air in the lower region 
of the building. The cross-sectional area of the intake vents 
should therefore be at least twice as large as the cross- 
sectional area of the smoke and heat vents in the roof.

Sprinkler systems 
Wet sprinkler systems are systems in which the pipeline 
network behind the wet alarm valve station is permanently 
filled with water. When a sprinkler responds, water emerges 
from it immediately. 

In dry sprinkler systems, on the other hand, the pipeline 
network behind the dry sprinkler valve station is filled with 
compressed air, which prevents water from flowing into the 
sprinkler network. When the sprinkler system is triggered, 
the retaining air pressure is released and water flows to the 
sprinkler heads. Dry sprinkler systems are used where there 
is a risk of frost damage to the pipework. 

Normal sprinklers deliver a spherical water distribution 
towards the ceiling and the floor whereas the water from 
umbrella sprinklers falls in a parabolic pattern towards the 
floor. Both kinds can take the form of self-supporting or 
hanging devices. > @) + @) 

Automatic fire extinguisher systems commonly employ 
fixed pipelines to which closed nozzles (sprinklers) are 
connected at regular intervals. When the system is activated, 
water is released only from those sprinklers where the 
sealing devices have reached the set response temperatures 
required to open them. These types of arrangements are 
also known as selectively operated extinguishing systems.

Sprinkler distribution 

A choice can be made between a normal or staggered 
distribution of sprinklers but where a staggered distribution 
is proposed the sprinklers should be arranged in as uniform 
a way as possible. 


Spacing between sprinklers; distance from walls and 
ceilings 

The spacing between sprinklers must be at least 1.5m. The 
maximum spacing is determined as a function of the area 
the sprinkler is protecting, the distribution of the sprinklers 
and the fire hazard. This rule does not apply to sprinklers in 
stacking systems. 


EXTINGUISHER SYSTEMS 


The permissible spacing between sprinklers and flat 
ceilings/roofs varies according to the type of sprinkler and 
the flammability of the inside of the ceiling or roof. It also 
depends on the insulating layer of profiled cladding roofs. 
For trapezoidal section cladding roofs, the minimum 
spacing of the sprinkler from the ceiling is measured from 
the lowest point of the corrugation and the maximum 
spacing is measured from the mean point between the 
lowest and highest points of the corrugations. 


Spacing of sprinklers relative to supporting beams or 
other structural components 

If supporting beams, joists or other obstructions (e.g. air 
conditioning ducts) run below the ceiling, then the 
minimum spacings must be maintained between these 
components and the sprinklers. The exceptions here are 
side wall sprinklers, installation of which is only permitted 
for flat ceilings. 


Open nozzle systems 

Systems with open nozzles are water distribution systems 
with fixed pipelines, to which open nozzles are attached at 
regular intervals. When on standby, the pipe network is not 
filled with water. When the system is activated, the peak 
flow pressure passes immediately from the water supply 
into the network of pipes and nozzles. 

The water pressure is directed according to the size and 
shape of the room which is to be protected and the type 
and quantity of the contents. Depending on the height and 
type of storage facility, and any wind effects, the system 
must deliver between 5 and 60 litres per minute per square 
metre > @,. For room protection systems which are 
subdivided into groups, the area protected by a group 
should generally lie between 100m2 (high fire risk) and 
400 m2 (low fire risk). 

Water spray extinguisher systems are used, for 
example, in aircraft hangars, refuse bunkers and 
incinerator facilities, arenas, facilities for containers and 
combustible fluids, cable ducting, chipwood silos and 
factories, power stations, and factories making fireworks or 
munitions. 


Extinguisher water pipelines 

Extinguisher water pipelines are fixed pipes in structures. 
They make available the water supply for fire extinguisher 
hoses, which are connected by valve couplings that can be 
closed. There are two main types: (1) wet risers, which are 
extinguisher water pipelines that are continually under 
pressure, and (2) dry risers, which are pipelines to which 
extinguisher water is supplied by the fire service when it is 
required. Wet/dry risers are extinguisher water pipelines 
which, on the remote activation of valves, are supplied with 
mains water when required. (> p. 130.) 

The following are typical nominal pipe bore sizes for 
extinguisher pipes and wall hydrants: 

— where there are two interconnected access points: 

50mm minimum 

— where there are three interconnected access points: 

65mm minimum 

— where there are four or more interconnected access 

points: 80mm minimum. 
With wet risers, wall hydrants can be accommodated in 
built-in recesses or in wall cavities. The lower edge of the 
wall hydrant should be between 800 and 1000mm above 
floor level. 

Dry risers have a nominal diameter of 80mm and have a 
drainage facility. The couplings of the supply valve should 
be 800mm above the surface level of the surroundings and 
the hose connector valve should be 1200mm above floor 
level.

CO, FIRE EXTINGUISHER SYSTEMS 

Carbon dioxide works as an extinguishant by reducing the 
oxygen content in the air to a value at which the burning 
process can no longer be sustained. Being gaseous, it can 
flood the threatened area rapidly and uniformly to provide 
very effective protection. 

CO, is suitable for extinguishing systems in buildings 
containing the following substances and installations: 

- flammable fluids and other substances that react as 

flammable fluids when burning 

— flammable gases, provided that precautions are taken 

to ensure that following successful extinguishing, no 
combustible gas/air mixture forms 

- electrical and electronic equipment 

— flammable solids susceptible to water damage, such 

as paper and textiles, although fires involving these 
materials require high concentrations of CO, and 
prolonged exposure to put them out. 

Fixed CO, systems are frequently used in areas given over to: 

- machines that contain flammable fluids, or in which 

such fluids are used 

— paint manufacture, spray painting, printing, rolling 

mills, electrical switch rooms and data processing 

rooms. 
Typically, where these systems are to be used for the 
protection of rooms, one nozzle must not safeguard an area 
greater than 30m2. Where rooms are over 5m high, the 
nozzles used for general spraying of CO, must not only be 
installed in the upper portion of the room, under the ceiling, 
but also at a level approximately equal to one third of the 
room height. 

The function of CO, systems is to extinguish fires during 
the initial phase and to maintain a high CO, concentration 
until the danger of re-ignition has abated. These systems 
consist essentially of CO, containers, back-up supplies of 
extinguishant, the necessary valves and a fixed pipe network 
with a suitable distribution of open nozzles and devices for 
fire detection, activation, alarm and extinguisher operation. 


Powder extinguisher systems 
Extinguishing powders are homogeneous mixtures of 
chemicals that act as fire suppressants. Their base 
constituents are, for example, as follows: 

— sodium/potassium bicarbonate 

— potassium sulphate 

— potassium/sodium chloride 

— ammonium phosphate/sulphate. 
Since the powder is ready for use under normal conditions 
at temperatures of —20°C to +60°C, it is used for buildings, 
in closed rooms and also for outdoor industrial 
applications. Powder extinguishants are suitable, for 
example, where the following substances and installations 
are involved: 








EXTINGUISHER SYSTEMS 


— solid flammable substances such as wood, paper and 
textiles, where a suitable powder is required in all 
cases 

— flammable fluids and other substances which, when 
burning, react as flammable fluids 

— flammable gases 

- flammable metals, such as aluminium, magnesium 
and their alloys, for which only special extinguishant 
powders are employed. 

Examples of industrial areas where fixed powder systems 
are frequently used include chemical plant and associated 
process plant, underground oil storage facilities, filling 
stations, compressor and pumping stations, and transfer 
stations for oil and gas. There are also some installations in 
which powder extinguishants should not be used. These 
include areas housing, for example: 

— dust sensitive equipment and low-voltage electrical 
installations (e.g. telephone systems, information 
processing facilities, measurement and control 
facilities, distribution boxes with fuses and relays, 
etc.) 

— materials which are chemically incompatible with the 
extinguishant (i.e. there is the danger of chemical 
reaction). 


Halon room protection systems 
Halon is a halogenated hydrocarbon, usually bromotri- 
fluoromethane. Its extinguishing effect is based on the 
principle that it supresses the reaction between the burning 
material and oxygen. Halon systems can only be used in 
extinguishing areas where the room temperature will 
remain between -20°C and +450°C and neither should there 
be any equipment with an operating temperature above 
450°C in the extinguishing area. 
Halon 1301, for example, is suitable for fires in areas 
containing: 
— fluids and other substances that react as flammable 
fluids when burning 
- gases, provided that no combustible gas/air mixture 
can form after the fire has been extinguished 
- electrical and electronic equipment and plant. 
Examples of activities and areas for which halon systems 
are suitable include: 
—- paint manufacture, spray paint shops, powder 
coating plant 
~ electrical equipment rooms 
— electronic data processing and archiving rooms. 
The possibility of environmental damage cannot be 
excluded and should be considered where halon systems 
are proposed. 


Foam extinguishing systems 

Foam systems are used for extinguishing fires in buildings, 
rooms and outdoors, and they can also be used to form a 
protective layer over flammable liquids. The foam 
extinguishant is generated through the action of a 
water/foaming agent mixture with air. The foaming agents 
are liquid additives that consist of water-soluble products of 
protein synthesis and, if required, may contain additional 
fluorinated active ingredients. 

The key characteristics of foam extinguisher systems to 
be considered are the water application rate, the requisite 
amount of foaming agent and the minimum operating time 
(e.g. between 60 and 120 minutes, depending on the type of 
foam). The system should be sized so that, in the event of a 
fire, sufficient foam enters the protected area to provide an 
effective cover. Precautions must be taken to prevent the 
escape of flammable fluids from the protected area (e.g. 
upstands). Account must also be taken of flow and spraying 
distances, possible obstructions, and the spacing and type 
of objects to be protected.

FIRE PROTECTION: CLOSURES AND 
GLAZING 


Fire protection closures 
Fire protection closures are units comprising: 
— a door, or doors, with associated frames and fixings 
for the frame 
- a self-closing device (either a flat spring or door 
closer with hydraulic damping) 
- aclosing sequence regulator (on double doors) 
- relevant mechanisms required if sliding, roller or 
vertical lift doors are fitted 
—- adoor lock 
- a locking system with release devices for closures, 
which, during normal usage, must be held open and 
closed only in the event of fire. 
If a fire takes hold, considerable distortion can occur 
between the wall and the door. Fire protection doors should 
therefore be considered in conjunction with the method of 
construction of the wall (i.e. solid walls or stud 
construction) to ensure that the combination is effective 
and permissible. 
The level of fire resistance is dependent to a large degree 
on: 
— the size of the door and opening 
— the precision of manufacture 
— the standard of workmanship during installation. 


Smoke protection doors 

Smoke protection doors are suitable for the limitation of 
smoke propagation in buildings but they are not fire 
protection enclosures in accordance with fire regulations. 
These doors are self-closing doors that are intended, when 
closed, to stop smoke passing from one part of the building 
into another. 


Closures in walls of lift shafts 

Closures in lift shaft walls, particularly the doors, must be 
constructed to prevent fire and smoke being transmitted to 
other floor levels. The effectiveness of the closure is then 
only assured, if suitable lift shaft ventilation is available and 
the lift cage consists predominantly of fire resistant 
construction materials. The size of the ventilation openings 
will be given in the local building regulations. In general, a 
cross-section of at least 2.5% of the plan area of the lift shaft 
is required, but this must be at least 0.1m2. 


Fire protection glazing 

Fire protection glazing is a component consisting of a frame 
with one or more light transparent elements (e.g. panes of 
fire protective glazing), mountings, seals and means of 
fixing. It will resist fire, in accordance with the classification, 
for 30, 60, 90, or even 120 minutes. 


Heat radiation resisting glazing These are light 
transparent components that can be arranged vertically, 
horizontally or be inclined. They are suitable as fire 
protection glazing to impede the propagation of fire and 
smoke and the passage of heat radiation, according to their 
fire resistance period. Their stability will have been 
demonstrated in a strength test. 

Heat radiation resistant glazing loses its transparency in 
the event of fire and provides wall-like fire protection. This 
implies that thermal insulation must be preserved during 
the whole of the fire resistance period. 

This type of glazing is predominantly used internally, 
although recent developments have rendered it suitable for 
external use. 


Heat radiation resistant glass consists of two pre- 
stressed panes 6mm apart which are prefabricated as a 
type of double glazing unit. During manufacture, the air 
between the panes is replaced by an organic, water- 
containing substance (gel). In the event of fire, the 
individual pane exposed to the fire cracks and the gel 
then compensates for the heating by evaporation. Due to 
the scalding on the surface of the fire protective layer, the 
glass becomes discoloured and is then non-transparent 
to light. 

Alternatively, this type of glazing may also consist of 
three or four silicate glass panes, laminated with fire 
protection layers of gel containing an_ inorganic 
compound. These layers provide the fire retarding effect. 
The gel itself is formed from a polymer, in which the 
inorganic salt solution is embedded, which is highly 
water-retentive. 

In the event of fire, a thermal insulation layer forms and 
considerable amounts of energy are absorbed through the 
vaporisation of the water. This process repeats itself, layer 
by layer, until the gel in the intermediate layers between all 
of the panes has been dissipated. In this way, fire 
resistance times of 30, 60, 90 minutes and longer are 
achieved. 

The gel layers in this heat radiation resisting glazing can 
only tolerate temperatures between -—15°C and +60°C. With 
regard to temperatures above the permitted upper limit of 
+60°C, application in individual cases must be decided on 
the basis of the orientation of the facade to the sun and 
whether the absorption of radiation by the gel might result 
in the temperature limit being exceeded. If necessary, the 
intensity of radiation from the sun must be reduced 
through the use of protective glass or by other shading 
precautions. However, as a rule, such precautions are not 
necessary. 

These glazing systems usually have special steel 
glazing bars, which are thermally isolated, and the 
surfaces of the frames can be faced with aluminium, if 
required.

FIRE PROTECTION: GLAZING 


The typical maximum height is 3.50m, with a maximum 
individual pane size of 1.20 x 2.00m. There is also the 
possibility of replacing individual panes of glass with non- 
load bearing panels. 


Fire resistant glazing without heat radiation 
resistance’ These are light transparent components that 
can be arranged vertically, horizontally or be inclined. They 
are suitable as fire protection glazing to impede the 
propagation of fire and smoke according to their fire 
resistance period. They do not, however, prevent the 
passage of radiated heat. This type of glazing remains 
transparent in the event of fire and is as effective as glass 
for fire protection. 

Glazing without heat radiation resistance reduces the 
temperature of the radiating heat by about one half as it 
passes through the pane. 

This grade of fire resistance can be achieved by three 
different types of glass: 

(1)Wire reinforced glass with spot welded mesh such 
that in the event of breakage the glass pane is 
retained by the wire mesh. Maximum resistance up to 
90 minutes. 

(2)Specially manufactured double glazing 
Maximum resistance up to 60 minutes. 

(3) Pre-stressed borosilicate glass (for example, Pyran). 
Maximum resistance up to 120 minutes resistance as 
a single pane. 

The installation of this type of glazing in the fagades of high 
buildings can prevent the spread of fire from one level to 
another. This applies especially to high-rise buildings which 
are subdivided into horizontal fire compartments. On 
buildings with inside corners, an unimpeded spread of fire 
can occur in the region of windows but this can also be 
avoided by using this type of glazing. 

Generally, glazing without resistance to heat radiation 
should only be installed in places which do not serve as 
an escape route (for example, as light openings in 
partition panels). If used adjacent to escape routes, the 
lower edge of the glass should be at least 1.80m above 
floor level. The permitted use of this glazing must be 
decided on an individual basis by the relevant local 
building authority. 


units. 


Door glazing 
The frames for fire protection glazing, together with the 
light transparent elements (glass), ensure integrity 
according to grade of fire resistance in the event of fire. 
The following materials (and material combinations) 
have proved to be suitable for the construction of 
frames: 

— steel tube sections with an intumescent protective 


coating 

— plasterboard and wood with, for example, light metal 
(LM) facings 

— light metal sections with fire resistant concrete 
cores 


— heat radiation protected LM laminated sections 

—~ combined sections: concrete outside (paintable), 
inside of LM, sections of pre-cast concrete (paintable), 
hardwood sections, heat insulated profiles with 
steam relieved interstitial air gaps and light metal 
with fire resistant and penetration resistant concrete 
cores.

Water cooled structures in steel-framed 
buildings 


A closed circuit cooling system is created by connecting the 
upper column ends to header pipes from an overhead 
reservoir. The cooling medium flows to the lower column 
ends, which are connected to distributor pipes that lead to 
a riser pipe back to the overhead reservoir. Two circuit 
systems must be provided following the general structural 
arrangement of the building. In some cases, building 
regulations demand that, in the event of the destruction of 
a structural member, for example, as a consequence of an 
explosion, the overall structure must remain stable @). For 
this kind of catastrophic loading case (i.e. for the failure of 
every second support), a design stress of 90% of the yield 
point value is used as a basis for structural calculations. 

Typically, four 3m3 overhead tanks (i.e. 12m3 of water), 
are sufficient to counteract a normal fire of 90 minutes 
duration, involving a spread of fire to two floor levels. On 
the basis of expert opinion, this also gives a safety margin 
of almost a third in respect of the available water. 

Where the structural columns are outside the building, 
freezing of the cooling water is prevented by the addition of 
potassium carbonate in a 33% solution, lowering the 
freezing point to -25°C. Internal corrosion of the columns of 
the circulation pipework and of the tanks is prevented by 
the addition of sodium nitrite to the cooling liquid. 

A good example of the use of water cooling is the ten- 
storey building in Karlsruhe for the Landesanstalt fur 
Umweltschutz (Federal Institute for Environmental 
Protection). It has (12 + 12) x 2 = 48 steel columns, which are 
supplied with cooling water circulation such that the 12 + 12 
columns are alternately connected to separate water 
circuits. The two circulatory systems of the front and rear 
elevations are separate. 

Very high temperatures have also been measured on the 
steel structural elements due to normal warming by the sun 
in summer. In one instance, following an increase of 30°C, 
the approximately 33m long outer columns of the building 
expanded vertically by about 12mm, resulting in 
displacements of the supports for the continuous, multi- 
Span structural frame. This factor had to be taken into 
account in the design. Since differences in density of the 
cooling medium occur due to warming, not only by fire but 
also through solar radiation, a natural circulation of the 
coolant takes place and the columns which are heated by 
the sun are cooled. A favourable effect here is that each of 
the four cooling systems has columns on both the north 
and south side of the building, so that a temperature 
equalisation can take place. Column temperatures of -15°C 
and +50°C were therefore taken as the basis for calculation. 
Without the equalisation through the cooling medium, 
values of around —25°C and +80°C would have had to be 
assumed in demonstrating structural integrity. 


Fire resistance of steel structural elements 

The fire resistance duration of structural steel elements for 
a prescribed level of fire intensity is dependent on the rate 
of heat increase and the respective critical temperature of 
the element. The temperature of a steel member increases 
more rapidly as the ratio of the surface exposed to the fire 
increases in relation to the steel cross-section. Large steel 
cross-sections heat up at a slower rate given the same 
depth of coating, the same material and equal fire surface 
coverage, and therefore have a greater resistance to fire 
than smaller cross-sections.

An important influencing parameter for the heating up 
process is therefore the section factor Hp/A (i.e the ratio of 
the heated perimeter to nominal cross-sectional area. The 
characteristics of the coating material are also decisive to 
this heating up process, as is the adhesion of the coating to 
the steel surface. The heating up period can be calculated or 
obtained from fire tests in accordance with relevant 
standards. 

Steel components can fail if the ‘critical steel 
temperature’ is reached on critical cross-sections. The fire 
resistance period is therefore dictated by the time taken for 
the component to be heated up to this critical steel 
temperature. 

The relationship between section factor, depth of coating 
and the duration of fire resistance of steel columns and 
steel girders has been investigated for various types of 
covering. The results are widely available and should be 
considered in the light of the possible fire risks associated 
with the proposed building. 


Building regulations stipulate what measures must be 
taken to ensure that occupants of buildings can escape if 
there is a fire. If there are spaces in the building which 
have no direct access to the outside, then a route 
protected from fire that leads to safety must be provided. 

Different standards apply to different building types as 

follows: 

(1) dwellings, including flats 

(2) residential (institutional) buildings, namely those that 
have people sleeping in them overnight (e.g. hotels, 
hospitals, old people’s homes) 

(3) offices, shops and commercial premises 

(4) places of assembly and recreation, such as cinemas, 
theatres, stadiums, law courts, museums and the like 

(5) industrial buildings (e.g. factories and workshops) 

(6) storage buildings, such as warehouses and Car-parks. 

Special provisions must be made for escape from very tall 

buildings. 

Factors to be taken into account when designing means 
of escape from buildings are: 

e the activities of the users 

e the form of the building 

e the degree to which it is likely that a fire will occur 

e the potential fire sources 

e the potential for fire spread throughout the building. 

There are some assumptions made in order to achieve a 

safe and economic design: 

(1)Occupants should be able to escape safely without 
outside help. In certain cases this is not possible (e.g. 
hospitals) so special provisions need to be made. 

(2) Fire normally breaks out in one part of the building. 

(3) Fires are most likely to break out in the furnishings and 
fittings rather than in the parts of the building covered 
by the building regulations. 

(4) Fires are least likely to break out in the structure of the 
building and in the circulation areas due to the 
restriction on the use of combustible materials. 

(5) Fires are initially a local occurrence, with a restricted 


ehh ee | ees oe ee, Se eT a so et De De er TR Ww £2.22. Lae nnd amin sl nn 


area exposed to the hazard. The fire hazard can then 
spread with time, usually along circulation spaces. 

(6)Smoke and noxious gases are the greatest danger 
during early stages of the fire, obscuring escape 
routes. Smoke and fume control is therefore an 
important design consideration. 

(7) Management has an important role in maintaining the 
safety of public, institutional and commercial 
buildings. 


GENERAL PRINCIPLES 

The general principle applied in relation to means of escape 
is that it should be possible for building occupants to turn 
away from the fire and escape to a place of safety. This 
usually implies that alternative escape routes should be 
supplied. The first part of the route will usually be 
unprotected (e.g. within a room or office). Consequently, 
this must be of limited length, to minimise the time that 
occupants are exposed to the fire hazard. Even protected 
horizontal routes should be of limited length due to the risk 
of premature failure. The second part of the escape route is 
generally in a protected stairway designed to be non- 
combustible, and resistant to the ingress of flames and 
smoke. Once inside, the occupants can proceed without 
rushing directly, or via a protected corridor, to a place of 


MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM FIRE 


safety. This is generally in the open, away from the effects 
of the fire. 

In certain cases, escape in only one direction (a dead 
end) is permissible, depending on the use of the building, 
the risk of fire, the size and height of the building, the length 
of the dead end and the number of people using it. 

Mechanical installations such as lifts and escalators 
cannot be included as means of escape from fire. Nor 
are temporary devices and_ fold-down ladders 
acceptable. Stairs within accommodation are normally 
ignored. 

Due regard must be given to security arrangements so 
that conflicts with access and egress in an emergency are 
resolved. 


RULES FOR MEASUREMENT 

The rules for measurement relate to three factors: 
occupant capacity, travel distance and width of escape 
route. 

Occupant capacity is calculated according to the 
design capacities of rooms, storeys and hence that of the 
total building. If the actual number of people is not 
known, then they can be calculated according to standard 
floor space factors, giving the allotted metre area per 
person depending on the type of accommodation. 

Travel distance is calculated according to the shortest 
route, taking a central line between obstructions (such as 
along gangways between seating) and down stairs. 

Width is calculated according to the narrowest section 
of the escape route, usually the doorways but could be 
other fixed obstructions. 


MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM DWELLINGS 
The complexity of escape provisions increases with the 
height of the building and the number of storeys above 
and below the ground. However, there’ are 
recommendations that refer to all dwellings: 

Smoke alarms These should be of approved design 


and manufacture and installed in circulation areas near 
QaIlU IHlaIIUIGAULLUIC AIIU TIIDSDLAIITU TEE UlFLUUTaALIVUET alcGas iicai 


to potential sources of fire (e.g. kitchens and living 
rooms) and close to bedroom doors. Installation should 
be in accordance with the details of the manufacturer 
and the building regulations. The number of alarms 
depends on the size and complexity of the building, but 
at least one alarm should be installed in each storey of 
the dwelling, and several interlinked alarms may be 
needed in long corridors > 15m). Consideration must be 
given to ensure the easy maintenance and cleaning of 
the alarms. 

Innerrooms Escape from these might be particularly 
hazardous if the fire is in the room used for access. Inner 
rooms should therefore be restricted for use as kitchens 
or utility rooms, dressing rooms, showers or bathrooms, 
unless there is a suitable escape window at basement, 
ground or first floor levels. 

Basements Gases and smoke at the top of internal 
stairs makes escape from basements hazardous. 
Therefore basement bedrooms and inner rooms should 
have an alternate means of escape via a suitable external 
door or window. Regulations’ stipulate detailed 
dimensions for windows and doors used for escape 
purposes.

MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM FIRE 


Generally, single dwellings of three or more storeys (or, 
according to the UK Building Regulations, with one or 
more floors over 4.5m above the ground) require 
protected stairways of 30 minutes fire-resistant 
construction, furnished with self-closing fire doors. 

Dwellings divided into flats or maisonettes should 
have fire protected access corridors leading to protected 
common escape stairs. The provision of two stairs giving 
alternative escape routes is necessary in all but the 
smallest buildings. It is essential to provide for 
ventilation of escape corridors and stairs in order to 
dissipate smoke. 

Each flat or maisonette is regarded as a separate fire 
compartment so only the unit on fire needs to be initially 
evacuated. Hence, entrance doors to flats and 
maisonettes must be self-closing fire doors (30 minutes) 
and open into a protected internal lobby with self closing 
fire doors which give access to the rooms. (> @) + @) 


MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM BUILDINGS OTHER 
THAN DWELLINGS 
General guidelines cover the following features. 

Construction and protection of escape routes These 
cover the fire resistance of the enclosures including any 
glazed panels and doors (varying according to situation), 
headroom (2m minimum), safety of floor finish (non- 
slip), and ramps (not steeper than 1:12). 

Provision of doors These should open at least 90 
degrees in the direction of travel and be easily opened 
(use simple or no fastenings if possible). They should not 
obstruct the passageway or landing when open (use a 
recess if necessary) and be of the required fire/smoke 
resistance depending on the particular situation. Vision 
panels are required when the door may be approached 
from both sides or swings two ways. 

Construction of escape stairs Escape stairs should 
be constructed of materials of limited combustibility in 
high-risk situations (e.g. when it is the only stair, a stair 
from a basement, one serving a storey more than 20m 
above ground level, an external stair or one for use by 
the fire services. Single steps should be avoided on 
escape routes, though they are permitted in a doorway. 
Special provisions apply to spiral and helical stairs. Fixed 
ladders are not suitable as means of escape for the 
public. 

Final exits These should be very obvious to users 
and positioned so as to allow the rapid dispersion of 
escaping people in a place of safety, away from fire 
hazards such as openings to boiler rooms, basements, 
refuse stores etc. 

Lighting and signing Escape routes should be well 
lit with artificial lighting, and generally equipped with 
emergency escape lighting in the event of a power 
failure. Stairs should be on an independent circuit. In 
crucial areas, the wiring should be fire resistant. The 
exits must be well signposted with illuminated signs. 

Lift installations and mechanical services, etc. Lifts 
cannot be used as a means of escape. Because they 
connect storeys and compartments, the shafts must be of 
fire resisting construction. The lift doors should be 
approached through protected lobbies unless they are in 
a protected stairway enclosure. The lift machine room 
should be situated over the lift shaft if possible. Special 
recommendations cover the installation of wall-climber 
and feature lifts. Mechanical services should either close 
down in the event of a fire, or draw air away from the 
protected escape routes. Refuse chutes and refuse 
storage must be sited away from escape routes and 
separated from the rest of the building by fire resistant 
construction and lobbies. 


Horizontal escape routes 

The number of escape routes and exits required depends 
on the maximum travel distance that is permitted to the 
nearest exit and the number of occupants in the room, area 
or storey under consideration. 

Generally, alternative escape routes should be provided 
from every part of the building, particularly in multistorey 
and mixed-use buildings. Areas of different use classes (e.g. 
residential, assembly and recreation, commercial, etc.) 
should have completely separate escape routes. 

Below are examples of typical maximum permitted travel 
distances in various types of premises. If, at the design stage, 
the layout of the room or storey in not known (for instance, 
in a speculative office building) then the direct distance 
measured in a straight line should be taken. Maximum direct 
distances are two thirds of the maximum travel distance. 

— institutional buildings: 9m in one direction, 18m in 

more than one 

- office and commercial buildings, shops, storage and 

other non-residential buildings: 18m in one direction, 
45m in more than one 

— industrial buildings: 25m in one direction, 45m in 

more than one. 
There are more stringent and detailed requirements for 
places of special fire risk and plant rooms. 

Note how the travel distances are much reduced where 
escape is possible in only one direction. However, this is 
only suitable where the storey or room contains few people 
(e.g. less than 50). Rooms at the beginning of an escape 
route may only have one exit into the corridor; in this case

MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM FIRE 


the single directional travel distance should apply within 
the room and the two directional travel distance should 
apply to the distance between the furthest point in the room 
and the storey exit. 

The layout of the exits from a room or storey may be 
such that from certain parts of the room they do not offer 
alternative escape routes. Figure @) shows regulations as 
applied to two types of room configuration. If the angle of 
45 degrees cannot be achieved, then alternative escape 
routes separated by a fire-resisting construction should be 
provided, or the maximum travel distance will be that 
allowed for one direction of travel. 

The number of exits and escape routes required depends 
also on the maximum number of people in the area under 
consideration. Below are typical requirements: 

500 people 2 exits

values are:

The design of escape routes must take into account 
planning considerations such as: 

Innerrooms More stringent rules apply to these than in 
dwellings, such as reduced travel distances, restrictions on 
use and occupancy as well as construction and the 
provision of fire detection equipment. 

Relationships between horizontal escape routes and 
stairways It is important to avoid: the need to pass 
through one stairway to reach another; the inclusion of a 
Stairway enclosure as the normal route to various parts of 
the same floor; linking separate escape routes in a common 
hall or lobby at ground floor. 

Common escape routes by different occupancies These 
should be fire protected or fitted with fire detection and 
alarm systems. Escape from one occupancy should not be 
via another. 

Escape routes, design factors Fire protection to escape 
corridors should be provided for in all residential 
accommodation, dead ends and common escape routes. 
Other escape corridors should provide defence against the 
spread of smoke in the early stages of the fire. To prevent 
blockage by smoke, long corridors (>12m) connecting two 
or more storey exits should be divided by self-closing fire 
doors. Fire doors should also be used to divide dead-end 
corridors from corridors giving two directions of escape. 
See (4) for typical arrangements.

Vertical escape routes 

These are provided by protected escape stairs of sufficient 
number and adequate size. Generally, the rules requiring 
alternative means of escape mean that more than one 
stairway is required. The width of the stairs should allow 
the total number of people in the storey or building 
subjected to fire to escape safely. Wide stairways must be 
divided by a central handrail. The width should be at least 
that of the exits serving it, and it should not reduce in width 
as it approaches the final exit. Typical minimum escape 
stair widths, depending on the type of building and the 
number of people they serve, are as follows: 1000mm for 
institutional buildings serving up to 150 people; 1100 mm 
for assembly buildings serving up to 220 people; between 
1100mm and 1800mm for any other building serving more 
than 220 people, depending on the number of people and 
number of floors. 

Each internal escape stair should be contained in its own 
fire-resisting enclosure and should discharge either directly, 
or by means of a protected passageway, to a final exit. As 
protected stairways must be maintained as a place of 
relative safety, they should not contain potentially 
hazardous equipment or materials. These restrictions do 
however allow the inclusion of sanitary facilities, a lift well, 
a small enquiry office or reception desk, fire protected 
cupboards and gas meters.

MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM FIRE 


Reductions in the level of fire resistance are allowed on the 
outside wall of a staircase, depending on the proximity to 
other openings in the facade. 

Basement stairs need special attention. The danger of 
hot gases and smoke entering the stair and endangering 
upper storeys means that at least one stair from the upper 
storeys should not continue down to the basement. In 
continuous stairs, a ventilated lobby should separate the 
basement section from the section serving the upper floors. 

External escape stairs are usually permissible as an 
alternative means of escape, but should be adequately 
protected from the weather and fire from the building. They 
are not suitable for use by members of the public in 
assembly and recreation buildings. 


ACCESS FOR FIREFIGHTERS 


Provision should be made in design to allow firefighters 
good access to the building in the event of a fire, and to 
provide facilities to assist them in protecting life and 
property. 

Sufficient access to the site for vehicles must be 
provided to allow fire appliances to approach the building. 
Principal appliances are ladders, hydraulic platforms and 
pumping appliances. Access roads for fire appliances 
should be at least 3.7m wide with gates no less than 3.1m. 
Headroom of 3.7m for pumps and 4.0m for high-reach 
appliances is required. The respective turning circles of 
these appliances are 17m and 26m between curbs. Allow 
5.5m wide hardstanding adjacent to the building, as level as 
possible (not more than 1:12), with a clearance zone of 2.2m 
to allow for the swing of the hydraulic platform. 

Firefighters must be able to gain access to the building. 
The normal escape routes are sufficient in small and low 
buildings, but in high buildings and those with deep 
basements additional facilities such as firefighting lifts, 
stairs and lobbies, contained within protected shafts, will be 
required. 

Fire mains in multistorey buildings must be provided. 
These may be wet or dry risers (fallers in basements). 

A means of venting basements to disperse heat and 
smoke must be provided. In basements, flames, gases and 
smoke tend to escape via stairways, making it difficult for 
firefighters to gain access to the fire. Smoke vents (or 
outlets) are needed to provide an alternative escape route 
for these emissions directly to the outside air and allow the 
ingress of cooler air. Regulations stipulate the positions and 
sizes of vents. Either natural venting or mechanical venting 
in association with a sprinkler system may be used.

PROTECTION FROM LIGHTNING 


Around a latitude of 50°, lightning strikes the ground 
approximately 60 times (and cloud 200-250 times) per hour 
of storms. Within a radius of 30m from the point of strike 
(trees, masonry work, etc.), persons in the open air are in 
danger from stepped voltages and, consequently, should 
stand still with their feet together. 

The damage liable to be inflicted on building 
constructions is due to the development of heat. Ground 
strikes heat and vaporise the water content to such a degree 
that walls, posts, trees, etc., can explode due to the 
Overpressure generated wherever dampness has collected. 
Roof structures, dormer windows, chimneys and ventilators 
should receive particular attention in lightning protection 
systems and should be connected into the system. 

A lightning protection system consists of lightning rods, 
down conductors and earthing devices. In essence, a 
lightning protection system represents a ‘Faraday cage’, 
except that the mesh width is enlarged. Also, initial contact 
points (or lightning rods) are fitted, so that the point of 
impact of the strike can be fixed. Thus, the lightning 
protection system has the function of fixing the point of 
lightning strike by means of the air terminals and ensuring 
that the structure lies within a protected zone. 

The air terminals or lightning conductors are metal rods, 
roof wires, surfaces, roof components or other bodies. No 
point on the roof surface should be further than 15m from 
an air terminal device. 

On thatched roofs, due to the danger of ignition resulting 
from the corona effect, metal bands (600mm wide) should 
be laid over the ridge on wooden supports —> (8). When 
flowing, a lightning current can reach 100000A and, due to 
the earthing resistance, a voltage drop of 500000V occurs. 
In the instant of the strike, the entire lightning protection 
system, and all components which are connected to it by 
metal parts, are subjected to this high potential. 

Equipotential bonding is the very effective precaution of 
connecting all large metal components and cables to the 
lightning protection system.

PROTECTION FROM LIGHTNING 


The earthing system is required to conduct the lightning 
current rapidly and uniformly to earth; this is achieved by 
using uninsulated metal bands, tubes and plates, pushed so 
deep into the ground that a low resistance to ground 
dissipation is attained — 42 - @3. The level of earthing 
resistance depends on the type of ground and the 
dampness - (1). A distinction is made between deep 
earthing electrodes and surface earthing electrodes. 
Surface earthing electrodes are designed either in a ring 
shape or in a straight line; preferably, they are embedded in 
the concrete of the foundations — @2 - @. Rod earthing 
electrodes (round rods or rods with an open profile) are 
contained in a tube driven into the ground. Earthing 
electrodes inserted to a depth of more than 6m are called 
‘buried earth electrodes’. A star type earth electrode is one 
consisting of individual strips which radiate out from a 
point or from an earthing strip. On roofs, walls, etc., clad in 
aluminium, zinc or galvanised steel = @) - ©), bare or 
galvanised copper conductors are not permissible; instead 
bare aluminium conductors or galvanised steel conductors 
should be used.

AERIALS 


Aerials affect the appearance of cities, and, when close together 
and in the same line of sight to the transmitter, they are subject 
to mutual interference. Communal aerials can solve these 
problems, but planning of these is needed at the initial stage of 
construction. Provision should be made in the basic construction 
of buildings for the space requirement and installation of 
facilities for amplifiers to oppose the current drop in the cabling 
and to provide adequate earthing — (6) - © plus the additional 
equipment needed to earth the lightning protection system — 
p.138. For connections to water pipes, care is needed to avoid 
short circuiting water meters — ©). Aerial performance is 
strongly influenced by the surroundings > (1) e.g. trees 
extending above the aerial height -- evergreens, in particular — 
and overhead high voltage power lines. Good reception requires 
alignment (polarisation) with the nearest transmitter — the best 
position being when the aerial is in line of sight with the 
transmitter. Short waves do not follow the curvature of the Earth 
and ultra short waves only partially — a portion reaching the 
troposphere is reflected, so that TV reception may be possible 
even when the transmitter would not normally be of sufficient 
strength to reach the receiver. Various aerial shapes are 
available. Basic fundamentals should be observed — (3). Aerials 
under the roof, intended for the UHF range, provide low-quality 
reception. In the VHF range, the drop in reception relative to 
Outside aerials is only about half as great. Room aerials 
(auxiliary aerials) are many times weaker. One aerial should 
serve for the reception of long, medium, short, ultrashort waves 
and for a number of TV channels — with corrosion protection for 
long life. For aerial mast systems, reference should be made to 
the appropriate regulations > @). Normally, the aerial mast is 
inserted into the roof framework, on a support member with a 
span of at least 0.75m. On flat roofs, attachment to an outer wall 
is a practical proposition. Attachment to a chimney which is in 
use is disadvantageous due to the danger of corrosion. Aerials 
must not be mounted on roofs made from easily combustible 
roofing materials, e.g. straw or reeds; instead, mast or window- 
mounted aerials should be provided. Aerials are not required for 
wide band cable systems. In addition to the point of connection 
(to household), space should be provided in the cellar for the 
amplifier with mains connection.

LIGHTING: LAMPS AND FITTINGS 


Significant lighting parameters 
The radiated power of light, as perceived by the eyes, is measured 
in terms of the luminous flux ®. The luminous flux radiated per solid 
angle in a defined direction is referred to as the light intensity |. The 
intensity of a light source in all directions of radiation is given by the 
light intensity distribution, generally represented as a light intensity 
distribution curve (see following page). The light intensity 
distribution curve characterises the radiation of a light source as 
being narrow, medium or wide, and as symmetrical or 
asymmetrical. 

The luminous flux per unit area is the lighting intensity or 
illuminance E. Typical values: 


global radiation (clear sky) max. 100000 Ix 


global radiation (cloudy sky) max. 20000 Ix 
optimum sight 2000 Ix 
minimum in the workplace 200 Ix 
lighting orientation 20 Ix 
street lighting 10 Ix 
moonlight 0.2 Ix 


The lighting density L is a measure of the perceived brightness. For 
lamps it is relatively high and results in glare, which necessitates 
shielding for lights in indoor areas. The lighting density of room 
surfaces is calculated using the lighting intensity E and the degree of 
reflection. 


Lamps 
Lamps convert electrical power (W) into luminous power (lumen, Im). 
The light yield (Im/W) is a measure of efficiency. 

For internal room lighting, filament and discharge lamps are 
used > (4). 

Filament lamps typically provide warm white light that is flicker- 
free, can be dimmed without restriction and give very good colour 
rendering. They offer high lighting intensity, particularly in the case 
of halogen bulbs, and their compact size allows small lighting 
outlines and very good focusing characteristics (e.g. spotlights). 
However, filament lamps also have a low lighting efficiency (Im/W) 
and a relatively short bulb life of between 1000 and 3000 hours. 

Discharge lamps usually operate with a ballast device, and 
sometimes an ignition system, and offer high lighting efficiency with 
relatively long life (between 5000 and 15000 hours). The colour of the 
light depends on the type of lamp: warm white, neutral white or 
daylight white. Colour rendering is moderate to very good, but it is only 
possible to dim the lamps to a limited extent. Flicker-free operation can 
only be achieved by the use of an electronic ballast device.

LIGHTING: ARRANGEMENT 
Forms of Lighting for Internal Areas 


Direct, symmetrical lighting > @ is preferred for all general 
illumination of work rooms, meeting rooms, rooms in 
public use and circulation zones. The required level of 
illumination can be achieved with relatively little electrical 
power: standard values for specific loadings are given on p. 
147. When designing a lighting system, an angle of 
illumination between 70° and 90° should be tried first. 

Downlights (wall floods, louvre lighting) » @) can 
provide uniform wall illumination while the effect on the 
rest of the room is that of direct lighting. Wall floods on a 
power supply rail — @) can also give uniform wall 
illumination over the required area, depending on the 
separation between the lamp and the wall; up to 500Ix can 
be achieved. Fluorescent lamps and halogen filament lamps 
can also be used. 

Wall floods for ceiling installation = @ can be sited so as 
to provide low room light or illumination of one wall. These 
can also make use of halogen filament lamps and 
fluorescent lamps. 

Downlighting with directed spotlights = © using a 
regular arrangement of lamps on the ceiling and swivelling 
reflectors can give different lighting levels in the room. 
Halogen filament lamps are most suitable, in particular 
those with low-voltage bulbs. 

Indirect lighting - © can give an impression of a bright 
room free of glare even at low lighting levels, although the 
room must be sufficiently high and careful ceiling design is 
needed to give the required luminance. Energy 
consumption in this form of lighting is up to three times 
higher than for direct lighting so combinations are often 
used (e.g. 70% direct, 30% indirect) providing the room 
height is adequate (h>3m) > @. Fluorescent lamps are 
usually used in direct/indirect lighting, but they may also be 
combined with filament lamps. 

Ceiling and floor floods > - Q) are employed to 
illuminate ceiling and floor surfaces. They usually use 
halogen filament or fluorescent lamps, although high- 
pressure discharge lamps are also a possibility. 

Wall lights => are principally used for decorative wall 
lighting and can also incorporate special effects (e.g. using 
colour filters or prisms). To a limited extent, they can also 
be used for the illumination of ceilings or floors. 

Wall floodlights and spotlights on power supply rails 
+ @)-@2 are particularly useful in sale rooms, exhibitions, 
museums and galleries. With wall floodlights, typical 
requirements are for vertical illumination levels of 50Ix, 1501x 
or 300Ix; filament and fluorescent lamps are usually preferred. 
For spotlights, the basic light emission angles are 10° (‘spot’), 
30° (‘highlight’) and 90°(‘flood’). The angle of the light cone 
can be varied by passing the light through lenses (sculptured 
lenses, Fresnel lenses), and the spectrum of the light can be 
varied using UV and IR filters and colour filters. Shading can 
be arranged by means of louvres and anti-glare flaps.

LIGHTING: ARRANGEMENT 


Geometry of Lighting Arrangements 


The spacing between light fittings and between the light 
fittings and the walls depends on the height of the room 
»@a)-@. 

The preferred incidence at which light strikes objects and 
wall areas is between 30° (optimum) and 40°  6)- 6). 

The shading angle of downward lighting lies between 
30° (wide-angle lighting, adequate glare control) and 50° 
(narrow-angle lighting, high glare control) — a0, and 
between 30° and 40° in the case of louvred lighting.

LIGHTING: ARRANGEMENT 
Lighting Quality Characteristics 


Any good lighting design must meet functional and 
ergonomic requirements while taking cost-effectiveness 
into account. In addition to the following quantitative 
quality criteria, there are qualitative, in particular 
architectural, criteria which must be observed. 


Level of illumination 

A mean level of between 300 Ix (individual offices with 
daylight) and 750 Ix (large rooms) is required in work areas. 
Higher illumination levels can be achieved in uniform 


general lighting through the addition of lighting at 
Qa) Correct arrangement of lights in relation to work position: light workplace positions. 
from the side 





Light direction -; (1) 

Ideally, light should fall on a working position from the side. 
The prerequisite for this is a wing-shaped light distribution 
Curve (p. 142). 


Limitation of glare -. @-@ 

Direct glare, reflected glare and reflections from monitor 

screens should all be limited. Limiting direct glare is 

achieved by using lights with shading angles > 30°. 
Limiting reflected glare is achieved by directing light 

from the side onto the working position, in conjunction with 

the use of matt surfaces on the surrounding areas. > Q). 
Limiting reflections from monitor screens requires the 






(2) Working surfaces, monitor screens, keyboards and paper should correct positioning of the screen. Lighting which 
naveumart surieces nevertheless still reflects on a screen must have a 
eee ceeecsceseeeevveuuesseseses luminance of < 200 cd / m2 in these areas. 


Distribution of luminance 

paoeaie The harmonic distribution of luminance is the result of a 
for ceilings and walls careful balance of all the degrees of reflection in the room 
~ @. Luminance due to indirect lighting must not exceed 
400 cd/m2. 


Colour of light and colour rendering 

The colour of the light is determined by the choice of lamp. 
A distinction is made between three types: warm white light 
(colour temperature under 3300K), neutral white light 





@) pots which-can generate Luminance of indirect (3300-5000 K) and white daylight (over 5000K). In offices, 

reflections should have low : ; ‘ : f 

huinancelavels ia the lighting most light sources are chosen in the warm white or neutral 
critical incidence range white ranges. For colour rendering, which depends on the 


spectral composition of the light, stage 1 (very good colour 
rendering) should generally be sought. 


Calculation of point illuminance levels —. © 

The illuminance levels (horizontal E,, vertical E,), which are 
generated by individual light sources, can be determined 
from the luminous intensity and the spatial geometry 
(height h, distance d and light incidence angle «) using the 
photometric distance principle.

LIGHTING: REQUIREMENTS 


Calculation of mean illuminance 

In practice, it is often necessary to obtain an estimate of the 
mean intensity of illuminance (E,) for a given level of 
electrical power supplied, or the electrical power P required 
for a given level of illumination. E, and P can be estimated 
from the formula in @). The specific power P* required for 
this calculation depends on the type of lamps used _; 1), 
and relates to direct illumination. The correction factor k 
depends on the size of the room and the reflection levels of 
the walls, ceiling and floor > ©. 

If the calculation is to be made for rooms with different 
types of lighting, the components are calculated 
individually and then added together = @). 

Calculation of the illumination using the specific power 
is also applicable to offices. In the example, a rectangular 
room with an area of 24m? is equipped with 4 lights. From 
~ (8), with 2 x 36W lamps (connected value, including 90 W 
ballast), an illuminance of ca. 375 |x is achieved. 

In offices, in addition to conventional louvred mirror 
lighting, square louvred lighting with compact fluorescent 
lamps > @, or structured lighting — ©, are frequently 
installed. Lighting structures use a combination of power 
supply rails to carry spotlights. 


Floodlighting buildings 

The luminous flux required for lamps used to floodlight a 
building can be calculated from the formula in — (9). The 
luminance should be between 3cd/m?2 (free-standing 
objects) and 16cd/m?2 (objects in very bright surroundings).

LIGHTING: REQUIREMENTS 
Fluorescent Tubes for Advertising Displays 


Every type of text and arbitrary line styles can be 
reproduced using fluorescent tubes, including ornamental 
and figured representations. Control is simple using 
rheostats or regulating transformers. Fluorescent tubes are 
commonly used for cinemas, theatres, sales advertising and 
publicity. In offices and businesses, louvred or gridded 
ceilings may be installed under fluorescent tubes to provide 
predominantly downward lighting > @- ©. 

Strip-lights and elongated lighting panels allow soft 
uniform lighting to be achieved, which approximates 
daylight and has shadow effects. 

High-pressure mercury vapour lamps with fluorescent 
gas are used for the illumination of factories and workshops 
as well as for external lighting. 

Mixed-light lamps with fluorescent gas produce light 
similar to daylight, with good colour reproduction. These 
lamps have standard fittings, without a ballast device (e.g. 
general-purpose lamps). 


Transparent and Translucent Materials 


In determining the size, colour, window dimensions and 
lighting of a room, a knowledge of the translucence, scatter 
and reflected radiation of the materials to be used in the 
room is required. This is particularly important for effective 
artistic and economic design. 

A distinction is made between materials which reflect 
light + Q) with direct, totally scattered or partially scattered 
return radiation, and translucent materials with direct > @) 
- ©, scattered = @ or mixed translucence > @®). 

Note: Frosted glass with inside surface frosting (preferred 
owing to fewer soiling problems) absorbs less light than the 
same glass with external surface frosting > 6). 

Coloured silk lampshades with white linings which 
minimally reduce translucence absorb around 20% less 
light than those without linings and with greater 
translucence. 

Daylight glass which filters electric light to simulate 
sunlight absorbs approximately 35% of the total light. Glass 
which comes close to copying the scattered light of the sky 
must absorb 60-80%. 

Clear window glass is translucent to between 65 and 
95% of light. If poor-quality clear glass is used, particularly 
in the case of double or triple glazing, so much light is 
absorbed that it is necessary to increase the window size. 
This increase is not compensated for by the improved 
thermal insulation of the multi-paned window assembly. 

Sheet glass is made mechanically, and is ready for use 
without further processing. It is a clear, transparent glass 
which is colourless and uniformly thick. Both sides have 
even plane surfaces, and its transparency to light is 91-93%. 


Classification: Type 1: Best commercial quality product 
for rooms (living accommodation, 
offices). 

Type 2: Structural glass for factories, 
storerooms, cellars and glass floors. 


Glass of one type only should be used for glazed items 
which are sited next to each other. Such applications 
include window glazing, shop windows, doors, dividing 
walls, furniture construction, laminated safety glass and 
double-glazing units. Further processing might entail 
polishing, etching, frosting, stoving, silvering, painting, 
bending or arching. Special-purpose glass, such as silvered 
glass, dry plate glass, glass for automobiles and safety 
glass, is made in all thicknesses (| pp. 166-173).

DAYLIGHT 


General requirements for daylight illumination of internal 
areas 

All rooms which are to be used for permanent occupation 
must be provided with adequate natural light. In addition, 
appropriate visual links with the outside world must be 
safeguarded. 


Light, wavelength, light colour 
Within the electromagnetic spectrum — @), visible light 
occupies a relatively small band, namely 380-—780nm. Light 
(daylight and artificial light) is the visible band of 
electromagnetic radiation between ultra-violet and infra- 
red. The spectral colours which occur in this range each 
have corresponding wavelengths, e.g. violet is short wave 
and red is long wave. Sunlight contains relatively more 
short-wave radiation than a filament lamp, which has more 
long-wave radiation, i.e. a greater red light component. 
However, daylight is perceived by the human eye as being 
white, apart from at sunrise and sunset, when it appears 
red. 

The unit of measurement for illuminance (particularly 
artificial light) is the lux (Ix). The level of daylight in rooms 
is given as a percentage (see later). 


Astronomical fundamentals: position of the sun 

The radiation and light sources which give rise to daylight 
are not constant. The sun is the ‘primary light source’ of 
daylight - @) whatever the condition of the sky. The axis of 
inclination of the Earth (23.5°), the daily rotation of the Earth 
around its own axis and the rotation of the Earth around the 
sun over a period of 1 year determine the position of the 
sun as a function of the time of year and the day for each 
point on the surface of the Earth > ©». 

The position of the Earth is defined by two angles: the 
azimuth, o,, and the angle of elevation, y,. On a plan view > 
(3), the azimuth is the horizontal deviation of the position of 
the sun from 0°, where 0° = north, 90° = east, 180° = south 
and 270° = west as seen by the observer. On a vertical 
projection > @), the angle of elevation is the position of the 
sun over the horizon as seen by the observer. 

A number of measuring methods are used to determine 
the position of the sun at a given location, for example 
determination of the degree of latitude and the angle of 
elevation. 

The declination of the sun during the annual cycle results 
in four main seasons in the year. The equinoxes are on 21 
March and 23 September; this is when the declination of the 
sun is 0°. The winter solstice occurs on 21 December (the 
shortest day), when the declination of the sun ts —23.5°; the 
summer solstice occurs on 21 June (the longest day), when 
the declination of the sun is +23.5° (see next page, > (5). 

The position of the sun is given by the degree of latitude. 
On 21 March and 23 September, at 12.00 (a, = 180°), the 
zenith angle of the sun at any latitude is of the same 
magnitude as the angle of latitude. For example, at 51° 
north (Brighton), the zenith angle at 12.00 (a, = 180°) is 51° 
(see next page, > ©). The angle of elevation of the sun 
above the horizontal is 90° — 51° = 39°. 

On 21 June, at midday, 12.00 (a, = 180°), the sun is 23.5° 
higher than on 21 March and 23 September: 39° + 23.5° = 
62.5°. On the other hand, on 21 December the sun is 
23.5° lower than at the equinox: 39° — 23.5° = 15.5°. These 
deviations are the same for all degrees of latitude. 

Thus, the angle of elevation of the sun, corresponding to 
the time of year, can be determined for all degrees of 
latitude.

Solar position diagrams 

An example is shown of a solar position diagram for 51°N 
+ (7). The diagram shows the plan projection of the position 
of the sun, in terms of azimuth and elevation, at true local 


time, e.g. for Brighton on 23 September, sunrise is at 6.00 at 
Og 00° (caot); on the sams date at 12.00, mg — 100° (scuth) 


and the elevation angle is 39°; sunset is at 18.00, a, = 270°, 
on the same day. 

To determine the local course of the sun, a coloured 
solar position chart is used > (8). The chart contains the 
plan projection of the azimuth a, and the angle of elevation 
Y, Of the sun as a function of time of year and time of day 
for the appropriate angle of latitude and reference 
meridian. 

In order to determine the position of the sun, loop- 
shaped curves are given for each hour of the day. In these, 
violet is used for the first half of the year and green for the 
second. The looped shape of the hourly curves is 
attributable to the elliptical path of the Earth and the 
inclination of the ecliptic. The times shown relate to the 
given time reference meridian, i.e. to the time zone of the 
location in question. 

The intersection points of the daily curves with hourly 
curves of the same colour mark the position of the sun at 
any hour of the day. On the orange coloured polar diagram, 
the position of the sun can be read off as an angle of 
direction of the sun (azimuth) and angle of elevation of the 
sun (height) > @). 


Projection of the solar path 

By using a stereographic projection — @), the path of the sun 
can be determined for each degree of latitude (for the 21st 
day of each month) as a function of time of year and time of 
day. 


Solar position, clock time and determination of time 

The position of the sun determines the daylight conditions 
according to the time of day and time of year. The true 
local time (TLT) is the usual reference for time of day (e.g. 
in the solar position charts) in determining daylight. Each 
location is allocated to a time zone, within which the same 
time (zone time) applies. If the time zone input is of 
interest, then the TLT must be converted to the 
appropriate time zone. 











Stereographic projection of the path of the sun, e.g. for latitude 
51° on 21 March and on 23 September: sunrise at 6.00, sunset 
at 18.00, y, = 39° at 12.00

Position of the sun: shadows, methods employed 

The following methods are employed to determine and 
verify the actual solar radiation and shadow, both inside 
and outside buildings, as a function of geographical 
location, time of year and time of day, structural features 
and surrounding conditions. 


Graphical construction of shadows. Determination of the 
shadows cast by a building can be accomplished using the 
projected (apparent) course of the sun, represented in —> (9) 
(see previous page), by means of a plan and an elevation. 
As an example, the shadows in a courtyard in Brighton, 
latitude 51°N, will be constructed for 21 March, at 16.00. The 
sun appears at this time at an azimuth angle (a,,) of 245° 
and an elevation (y,,) of 20° > Q) + @0. The positional plan is 
orientated with the north. The directions of the shadows are 
determined by the horizontal edges of the building, that is, 
a parallel shift of the direction of the sunshine (a,, = 245°) 
due to the corners of the building. The length of the shadow 
is determined by the vertical edges of the building, that is, 
a rotation of the true height of the building (h) and 
application of the elevation angle of 20°. The point of 
intersection with the direction of the shadow gives the 
length of the shadow. 


Panorama mask. |n many countries, a representation of the 
path of the sun is available for various geographical areas. 
These representations are printed on clear film, and include 
data on azimuth and elevation angles, as well as time of 
year and time of day. In use, a copy of the relevant sheet is 
bent in a curve and positioned in the direction of the sun 
+ @). By looking through the panorama mask, any 
encroachment of shadows from the surroundings and from 
overhead shadows is transferred to the printed path of the 
sun, on a scale of 1:1 > (2. The film can then be used to 
analyse the occurrence of shadows and sunshine on 
fagades and on sections of buildings to the correct scale. 


Horizontoscope. The horizontoscope is an aid to 
determining the true conditions of sunshine and shadow on 
building sites and on and in buildings. The horizontoscope 
consists of a transparent dome, a compass, the base and 
exchangeable curved sheets which are placed on the base, 
according to the task in hand, to investigate light, radiation 
or heat, etc. 

The purpose of the horizontoscope is to construct the 
light and shade conditions which exist in a room, e.g. > 49. 
At a particular point in the room, the opening for incident 
light can be assessed by means of a window cut-out 
projected on the dome and at the same time on the curved 
sheet underneath. It is therefore possible to determine both 
the radiation conditions and light effects in the room for 
each point in the room, and for any time of day and time of 
year, depending on the alignment of the building — 49. 


Model simulation. |n order to simulate and establish 
accurate annual shadow and solar radiation effects in and on 
a building, it is possible to construct a true-to-scale model 
and to test it under an artificial sun (parallel light) — @4.

DAYLIGHT 


Meteorological features 

The radiation of heat and the intensity of the sunlight on the 
surface of the Earth over the course of the year are 
determined by the geographical latitude, the weather and 
the varying conditions of the sky (clear, clouded, dull, partly 
clouded, etc.). 

The facts given below are important with regard to our 
typical patterns of daylight and sunshine duration. 

There are 8760h in a year. The duration of ‘bright 
daylight’ during the course of a year amounts to around 
4300h on average. 

The number of hours of sunshine per year varies from 
one country to another. Even within the same country it 
may vary from one location to another. The majority of 
these hours of sunshine usually occur during summer. 

Over most of the year, that is, during 2/3 of the daylight 
hours, the sunlight that reaches the Earth is scattered to a 
greater or lesser degree owing to the local weather 
conditions. 

The direct and indirect solar radiation (global radiation) 
which reaches the surface of the Earth produces a locally 
varying climate on the surface and in its near vicinity (see > 
(5). The periods of sunshine are considered in units of 
tenths of hours. The data represent only the macro-climate; 
local variations in the micro-climate are not accounted for. 
Climatic data relating to a specific location (temperature, 
sunshine duration, sky conditions etc.) can be obtained, for 
example, from the Meteorological Office in Bracknell, UK. 

During ‘bright daylight hours’, varying intensities of 
solar radiation are received on the surface, depending on 
the geographical latitude and the weather conditions, as are 
varying qualities of daylight —> (6. 


Physical basis of radiation 

Solar radiation is a very inconstant source of heat. Only a 
small proportion of the solar energy radiated toward the 
Earth is transferred to the surface of the Earth as heat 
energy. This is because the Earth’s atmosphere diminishes 
the solar radiation and does not permit a uniform intensity 
to penetrate to the surface. 

This reduction essentially occurs because of various 
turbidity factors, such as scatter, reflection and absorption 
of the radiation by dust and haze (the cause of diffuse 
daylight), and also because of the water vapour, carbon 
dioxide and ozone in the air. 

The total energy of solar radiation reaching the Earth is 
transmitted in the wavelength range 0.2-3.0um. 
Distribution of the total energy on the Earth's surface is as 
follows: approximately 3% ultra-violet radiation in the 
wavelength range 0.2-0.38um; approximately 44% visible 
radiation in the wavelength range 0.38-0.78um (the 
maximum lies at 0.5um in the visible light range); 
approximately 53% infra-red radiation in the wavelength 
range 0.78-3.0um. 

The chart shown in > @) represents the solar radiation 
which reaches the Earth. This is the solar constant, and has 
a value in our region of approximately 1000W/m2 on an 
illuminated vertical surface. 

The radiation power is reduced by very thick cloud to 
approximately 200W/m2, and in the case of only diffuse 
radiation (a cloudy sky with the sun completely obscured) 
to approx. 50-200 W/m2 (see -— (6).

DAYLIGHT 
Global Radiation 


The effective solar radiation on a building (on the surfaces 
which are aligned with the direction of radiation at the time) 
is referred to as the global radiation E,g. This is the sum of 
the ‘direct’ and ‘diffuse’ solar radiation (conditioned by the 
Earth’s atmosphere and due to the scattered radiation 
caused by the varying conditions of the sky), given in W/m2 
or in Wh/m2 per month or per day or per year. In the case of 
diffuse and direct radiation, the component of the radiation 
which is reflected from neighbouring buildings, roads and 
bordering surfaces, for example, must be taken into 
account (particularly when such reflections are strong). 

Global radiation can be employed as a source of heat, 
directly for ‘passive use’ through structural measures (e.g. 
glass surfaces to utilise the greenhouse effect or internal 
heat storage walls) > (9, or indirectly by ‘active use’ (e.g. 
using collectors, solar cells) —> for the energy 
requirements of a building. Also, the proportion of global 
radiation received directly determines the effective heating 
influence of the sun on the cooling load, which has to be 
calculated in the layout of heating and ventilation systems 
for each type of building. 

The necessary global radiation on buildings and 
collector surfaces for the utilisation of solar energy must be 
determined. This is related to the location of the building, 
and can be obtained as an energy parameter. 

~+ (9) shows the horizontal irradiance in W/m? due to the 
sun E,s and the sky E,,, as a function of the elevation of the 
sun for clear skies. The horizontal global irradiance E,, is 
the sum of the components generated by the sun E,csand 
the sky Egy. 

Application: In order to be able to determine the actual 
amount of solar energy to be used, the contributions must 
be presented as functions of the inclination and, if 
necessary, the orientation of the surfaces of the building, 
corresponding to > 41. The horizontal irradiance can be 
obtained from — @9. 

+ @0 shows the reduction of the incident level of solar 
radiation as a consequence of the different inclinations 
(0-90°) and orientations. 

In the case of a vertical surface, only about 50% of the 
annual horizontal global irradiance can be utilised. 

The quantity of radiation incident on a vertical, but 
differently orientated, surface under a cloudless sky can be 
read off the graphs in — @%, at least for the highest and 
lowest positions of the sun. 


Passive and active solar systems 
The energy requirement for a building in northern Europe 
during the 8-month period of heating in winter is relatively 
high in comparison to that required during the months from 
May to August. During the months of September and April, 
although the global radiation component is not very 
intensive (see > @2), part of the energy requirement of a 
building (heating, domestic water, ventilation etc.) can be 
covered by the use of the thermal energy of the 
surroundings, which again places emphasis on the problem 
of long-term storage. 

In the application of solar energy, a distinction is made 
between two main systems according to their principle of 
operation: active or passive.

Active systems are those in which the heat gain and heat output 
processes are driven by equipment installed in the building. They are 
also referred to as indirect systems, since the heat output occurs after 
the conversion processes. The operating principle of an active 
system is represented in —> @3) as a heat cascade. The heat gain can 
be achieved by means of solar collectors or something similar. 

In passive systems, the solar energy is used ‘directly’. This 
means that where the form of the building, the material, the type of 
construction and the individual components are suitable, the 
incident solar radiation is converted into heat energy, stored and 
then given out directly to the building. 

Four physical processes which are important to the heat gain, 
conversion and output are described below. 

(1) Thermal conduction > @4, () 

When a material absorbs solar radiation, this energy is converted 
into heat. Heat flow is caused by a temperature difference, and is 
also dependent on the specific thermal capacity of the material 
concerned. For example, if the temperature of the surroundings is 
lower than that of a heated wall, then the ‘stored’ heat energy Is 
transferred to the surroundings. 

(2) Convection > @4, @) 

A wall or other material heated by solar radiation gives back the 
available energy to the surroundings, according to the temperature 
difference. The greater the temperature difference between wall and 
surroundings, the greater the amount of heat given up. Air that is 
heated in this process will rise. 

(3) Thermal radiation > @4, @) 

Short-wave solar radiation is converted into long-wave (infra- 
red) radiation on the surface of the material. The radiation is emitted 
in all directions, and is dependent on the surface temperature of the 
materials. 

(4) Collectors > @4, @ 

Sunlight penetrates glass surfaces which are orientated towards 
the south. Solar radiation converted inside the room (long-wave 
radiation) cannot pass back through the glass, and thus the inside of 
the room is heated (greenhouse effect) > @4, @). 

In any application of the systems described above, account must 
be taken of storage, controllability and distribution within the 
building. 


Summertime thermal insulation 

Summertime thermal insulation is recommended for transparent 
facades in buildings with natural ventilation in order to avoid the 
possibility of overheating. The recommendations are as follows: The 
product of the total energy transmission factor (g) (> @5)) x the solar 
protection factor (z) (> @7) x the window surface component (f) on 
the facade, i.e. g x z x f, should have a value of 0.14-0.25 for strongly 
constructed buildings, and a value of 0.12-0.17 for those of lighter 
structure (see — @6). 

Extensive solar shading precautions > should be critically 
evaluated, since wide-ranging visual effects may result and the view 
may be permanently impaired > @8. 

The interplay of natural surroundings, physical laws and the 
development of constructional styles in specific materials means 
that each case requires accurate, individual analysis > @9.

DAYLIGHT 


The measurement and evaluation of daylight in internal 
areas with light admission from the sides and above. 

The daylight in internal areas can be evaluated according 
to the following quality criteria: illuminance and brightness; 
uniformity; glare; shadow. 

Basis: In evaluating daylight in internal areas, the 
illuminance of a clouded sky (i.e. diffuse radiation) is taken 
as the basis. Daylight admitted to an internal area through 
a side window is measured by the daylight factor D. This is 
the ratio of the illuminance of the internal area (Ei) to the 
prevailing external illuminance (Ea), where D = Ei/(Ea x 
100)%. Daylight in internal areas is always given as a 
percentage. For example, when the illuminance of the 
internal area is 500 Ix and the external tIluminance is 5000 
Ix, then D = 10%. 

The daylight factor always remains constant. The 
illuminance of an internal area varies only in proportion to 
the external illuminance prevailing at the time. The external 
illuminance of a clouded sky varies from 5000 Ix in winter to 
20000 Ix in summer -» 60, and depends on the time of year 
and the time of day. 

The daylight factor at a point P — @? is influenced by 
many factors. D = (DH + DV + DR) xt x k1 x k2 x k3, where 
DH is the component of light from the sky, DV is the effect 
due to neighbouring buildings, DR is the contribution from 
internal reflections, and the following reduction factors are 
taken into consideration: t, the light transmission factor for 
the glass; k1, the scatter effects due to the construction of 
the window; k2, the scatter effects due to the type of 
glazing; k3, the effects of the angle of incidence of the 
daylight. 

The reference plane for the horizontal illuminance of 
daylight in an internal area is as shown in = @2. It can be 
taken as 0.85m above floor level, and is separated from the 
walls of the room by 1m. The points EP used for the 
horizontal illuminance are fixed on this reference plane. The 
corresponding (to be determined) daylight factors can then 
be represented in the form of a daylight factor curve — 62. 
The shape of the curve on the section provides information 
about the horizontal illuminance on the reference plane (at 
the corresponding points), and then Dmin and Dmax can be 
established (see also uniformity). The curve of the daylight 
factor also provides information on the variation of daylight 
in the room. 

Required daylight factors D%. The relevant, currently 
valid requirements are laid down in regulations relating to 
daylight in internal areas and in the guidelines for work 
areas. Since no other relevant data are available at present, 
the required variation in daylight can be determined and 
checked from the uniformity (see later). 

On the assumption that living rooms are comparable in 
terms of their dimensions with work rooms, the following 
values for the required daylight factors should be adhered 
to: 

Dmin > 1% in living rooms, reference point the centre of 

the room — 63; 

Dmin = 1% in workrooms, reference point the lowest 

position in the room = 83; 

Dmin = 2% in workrooms with windows on two sides; 

Dmin = 2% in workrooms with light coming from above, 

with the minimum mean daylight factor (Dm) > 4%. 
Note: With side windows, the associated maximum daylight 
factor should be at least six times greater than the 
minimum requirement, and in the case of light from above 
in workrooms, Dm should be twice as large as Dmin. 
Several examples for different internal area illuminance 
requirements as a function of external illuminance are 
shown in > @9.

Summary of visual links with outside and window sizes 








DAYLIGHT 


Brightness, window sizes and visual links 

The position, size and type of windows essentially 
determine the pattern of daylight in an internal area G5). 
The appropriate window sizes for living and work rooms of 
various dimensions are defined in _ 68). The following 
conditions provide the basis for these calculations for living 
rooms: 

° D% = 0.9 at the centre of a living room and at the 
lowest point in a workroom, 
width of window = 0.55 x room width, 
clouded sky, 
reflection from the wall = 0.6, 
reflection from the ceiling = 0.7, 
reflection from the floor = 0.2, 
light losses from the glass = 0.75, 
light losses from window-frame scatter k1 = 0.75, 
light losses from contamination k2 = 0.95, 
reflected light from neighbouring buildings Dv = 0.2, 
angle of light reflected from neighbouring buildings a 
= 0-50° (see — 66 + 6). 

Note: This applies by analogy to workrooms when their 
dimensions correspond to those of living rooms: 

°* room height (h) < 3.50m, 

* room depth (t) < 6m, 

° room area (A) < 50m2. 

Visual links with the outside also demand the requisite 
window dimensions for living rooms and workrooms. 
Minimum recommended requirements are summarised in 
x and > @9. These recommendations contain the 
following points: 

° limiting clearances and clearance areas for the 

relevant building heights must be maintained, 

° visual link with the outside is a requirement for all 

accommodation; 

° as a rule, a window size of approx. 1/s-1/10 of the 

usable room area must be provided for living rooms. 
Among other factors in the town planning interpretation of 
building instructions and standards, incident light, building 
Separation, the external aspects of neighbouring buildings 
and window design all have to be taken into account > 40. 
For example, a building separation of B = 2H (> 27°) is the 
desired value. This results in an aperture angle of > 4° 
(limited by building geometry and neighbouring buildings) 
to achieve the minimum level of daylight in rooms. 

Newly developed town planning schemes should be 
carefully checked for the quality of light in internal areas 
since, in general, the building regulations and standards 
only set minimum requirements. 

It is advisable to carry out a visual inspection of the 
designs to check the expected appearance of internal and 
external areas, either in model form, under an artificial sun 
and artificial sky, or using an endoscope device.

DAYLIGHT 


luminance, level of reflection, colour rendering and glare 
The interplay of these characteristics of daylight has a great 
influence on the brightness in internal areas. To fulfil 
specific visual tasks, specific daylight illuminance levels are 
required, depending on the type of activity > 4). Therefore, 
the choice of reflection levels for the walls has to be 
coordinated with the requirements of the visual tasks which 
are to be performed. The varied structuring of the 
brightness in a room is dependent on the reflection levels of 
the surfaces and the choice of arrangement of the windows 
in the fagade — @2 (and see also — 65). 

The uniformity G of the daylight illumination (defined as 
Dmin/Dmax) should be > 1:6 in the case of light from the 
side > @3). In the case of light from above, G > Dmin/Dmax 
1:2 = @4. This, in principle, characterises the variation of 
daylight in internal areas. The uniformity is better in the 
case of overhead illumination, since the zenith luminance is 
three times greater than the luminance on the horizon. 

Measures used to vary the uniformity can be influenced 
by: 

e the level of reflection (if very high), 

e the direction of any glare, 

e the arrangement of the windows. 

Glare is caused by direct and indirect reflection from the 
surfaces and by unfavourable luminance contrasts — 45), @6. 
Measures for the avoidance of glare include: 

e solar shading outside, 

¢ glare protection, inside and outside, in association 

with solar shading, 

¢ matt surfaces, 

® correct positioning of daylight-enhancing illumination. 
Shadow is desirable to a certain degree, in order to be able 
to distinguish objects or other aspects of the room (> 4, 
schematic). Measures required for a more. three- 
dimensional shadow effect in the case of side lighting 
include: 

e solar shading, 

¢ glare protection (even in the north), 

¢ balanced distribution of daylight, 

® no direct glare, 

¢ multi-layered or staggered facade. 

Measures for appropriate shading with light from above 
include: 

® incident daylight on the lower edge of the light 

opening, through translucent materials, light gratings 

or similar filters (+ @§, schematic), 

daylight-enhancing illumination, 

bright matt surfaces combined with coloured 

differentiation (e.g. a supporting structure). 
Summary: Quality criteria, daylight coming from the side. In 
essence, the named quality criteria for daylight must be 
interpreted in such a way that spatial identity results. The 
variation of daylight in the internal area, combined with a 
good external view, are largely the result of the design of 
the facade, that is, the transition from inside to outside. A 
staggered, multi-layered and simultaneously transparent 
transition from inside to outside can satisfy the various 
requirements relating to daylight throughout the seasons of 


the year — @9.

Light redirection (light from the side) 

As the depth of a room increases (normally 5-7 m), the intensity 

of the daylight in the room diminishes (see daylight factor 

curve). Redirecting the light allows rooms to be completely 

illuminated with daylight, even rooms of considerable depth. 
The redirection of the light is based on the principle that the

Methods and procedures for determining the level of daylight 
(D%) in internal areas (side and overhead light) with a clouded 
sky 


A number of methods are available to determine the level of 
daylight, for example calculation, graphical methods, 
computer-supported methods and measurement techniques. 

In order to arrive at a basis for a decision on the ‘room to be 
built’ or the ‘building to be erected’, an approximate simulation 
of the daylight levels is recommended. This can be 
accomplished using drawing methods or with a model. 

However, the distribution of the daylight can only be 
determined and evaluated in three dimensions. Therefore a 
model of the room or building should be tested under simulated 
conditions so that the various effects of daylight can be 
examined. 

Experimental method. A model room was built with a 
suspended bright, matt, translucent ceiling, artificial 
illumination above the ceiling and a mirrored surface rotating in 
a horizontal plane which mirrored the surrounding walls. This 
simulated the actual effect of a uniformly clouded sky > 66. 

An illuminance of approx. 2000-3000 Ix was adequate. The 
external illuminance of the artificial sky was measured (Ea = 
2000 Ix), using a special purpose-made device, on a 1:20 scale 
architectural model. The illuminance in the inner area of the 
model was measured by means of a probe (Ei = 200Ix). Thus the 
daylight factor in the internal area had a value of 10% at point P. 
The variation of daylight in the model was determined using 
this method => 6). 

Different materials can be used to influence the variation in 
daylight, illuminance, colours effects, room dimensions, etc., 
but care should be taken that the quality criteria for daylight are 
maintained. The following materials can be used to experiment 
with the effects of light on the model: cardboard or paper of 
various colours, preferably pastels; transparent paper to 
prevent glare and to generate diffuse radiation; aluminium foil 
or glossy materials as reflective surfaces — 68. 


Daylight in internal areas with light from above 

The illumination of internal areas with daylight from ‘above’ is 
subject to the same prerequisites and conditions that apply to 
rooms with windows at the side, i.e. daylight illumination with 
a clouded sky. Whilst light from the side produces relatively 
poor uniformity of light distribution (and hence increased 
demand for D%), this is not the case with lighting from above. 
The quality of daylight in the latter case is significantly 
influenced by zenith luminance, room proportions, quality 
criteria, daylight from above and diminution factors. 

The best place to work in the room shown (-> 69) is at a 
distance from the side window which is equal to the height 
above the working position of the overhead light source. If the 
same level of illuminance that is produced by the overhead light 
on the reference plane (0.85m above floor level) is to be 
generated by light from the side window, then the window must 
be 5.5 times larger in area than the roof light aperture. The 
reason for this is that the light from above is brighter, since the 
zenith luminance is roughly three times the horizontal 
luminance. This means the light from above represents 100% of 
the light from the sky, whereas only 50% of the light from the 
sky is admitted through a side window. 

The illumination of a room from above is dependent on the 
proportions of the room, i.e. length, width and height (see — 
60). However, the possible occurrence of the ‘dungeon effect’ 
should be avoided. 

Quality criteria for overhead light. The variation of daylight 
(D%) in an internal area with side windows is characterised by 
Dmin and Dmax = 6%. A uniformity of G > 1:2 (Dmin/Dm) and a 
Dmin of = 2% is required for daylight illumination with overhead 
light in workrooms (Dm)min = 4% > 6).

DAYLIGHT 
Rooflighting 


Rooflights arranged at points on the ceiling area generate 
typical minimum and maximum brightnesses in the region 
where the light is required, the work plane. The mean value 
between these ‘bright’ and ‘dark’ areas is calculated, and 
this is termed the mean daylight factor Dm. 

Thus, Dm is the arithmetic mean between Dmin and 
Dmax with respect to the reference or work plane (0.85m 
above floor level). The required G > 1:2 is not based on 
Dmax, but on Dmin, since unevenness in the daylight from 
above is sensed physiologically as ‘stronger than contrast’. 
At this uniformity (Dmin = 1 and Dm = 2), Dmin must be > 
2% (compare — 6). 

Furthermore, the quality criteria striven for in controlling 
the overhead daylight in the room are limited by the room 
height and the shape of the rooflight (ke factor). 

An ideal uniformity is achieved when the spacing 
between the rooflights (O) is equivalent to the room height 
(h), i.e. a ratio of approximately 1:1. 

In practice the rule is that the ratio of rooflight spacing to 
room height should be 1:1.5-1:2 (see > 63). This figure 
contains a table from which these ratios and their effects 
can be obtained. The figure also provides a 
recommendation for the light shafts which should be let 
into the roof. 


Type of rooflight and construction 

The inclination of the rooflights determines the percentage 
of the light component from the sky which is available. In —> 
63a, the quantity of incident light admitted through a side 
window is compared with the quantity of light provided by 
rooflights at various inclinations. The greatest quantity of 
light is received through a horizontal rooflight. 

On the other hand, the maximum illuminance from a 
side window is achieved only in the vicinity of the window; 
for glazing which is vertically overhead, the lowest 
illuminance is on the reference plane. 

Thus there is a diminution factor (ky) for the quantity of 
incident light which depends on the angle of inclination of 
the rooflight. The diminution factors corresponding to shed 
roofs of various inclinations are shown in — @3b. 

The diffuse incident light which falls on the rooflight is 
affected by the construction and depth of the installation 
before it supplies the room with daylight. The various levels 
of incident light for shafts of different proportions beneath 
rooflights the are shown in > 6%. Excessively high and 
massive shafts and built-in depths should be avoided — @a, 
while a filigree, highly reflective construction is to be 
recommended - 65b. 

The quality of daylight in an internal area with rooflights 
is not only dependent on the factors discussed above. 
Another significant factor is the ratio of the total area of the 
overhead lights to the floor area of the room (kF factor). 

The diagrams in > 66 show the levels of daylight from 
side windows with various geometrical features and 
overhead illumination. 

In order to increase the daylight factor Dmin by 5% for 
side windows or opposite-facing rooflights, the proportions 
of the windows must be increased significantly, typically up 
to a ratio of 1:1.5. By contrast, for the same demands from 
overhead lighting, particularly with shed roof-type lights, 
the area need only be increased by a relatively small 
amount. A ratio of rooflight area to floor area of from 1:4 to 
1:5 is adequate. 

Additional diminution factors for rooflights are given

DAYLIGHT 


Empirical evaluation of the quality of daylight from overhead 
illumination 
The definitive evaluation of daylight conditions should be 
performed against the background of a clouded sky. However, 
rooflights are not only recipients of diffuse radiation, they are 
also subject to direct solar radiation. These varying lighting 
conditions should be simulated, not only under an artificial sky, 
but also under an artificial sun. In this process, the quality 
criteria for the daylight on the model should be assessed by eye 
— 67. 
Design parameters for overhead illumination are listed 
below (~ 68 — @2; see also — 65). 
® Rooflights should not be orientated toward the south. 
Convert solar radiation into diffuse light radiation. 
Maintain quality criteria for daylight. 
Avoid excessive contrasts in luminance levels. 
Pay attention to variation in Dm. 
Ensure illumination of all room corners and enclosing 
surfaces. 
@ Avoid glare by artificial shading. 
® Treat room-enclosing surfaces according to their 
separate technical requirements. 
¢ Ensure that it is possible to see outside.

Side and overhead lighting 

The choice between side and overhead illumination depends on 
the use to which the building is to be put and also on the available 
external light sources, i.e. the geographical location. For example, 
where there are extreme light and climatic conditions, appropriate 
forms of construction must be developed and the shapes of 
buildings must be designed to match the prevailing light 
conditions at that latitude (i.e. to make optimum use of the diffuse

Solar path: 
spring equinox (21 March) 
autumn equinox (23 September) 


Application 

The path of sunshine on a 
planned structure can be 
obtained directly from the 
following procedure if a plan 
of the structure, drawn on 
transparent paper, is laid in its 
correct celestial orientation 
over the appropriate solar 
path diagram. The following 
solar path data relate to the 
latitude region 51.5°N 
(London, Cardiff). 

For more northern areas, 
e.g. at 55°N (Newcastle), 3.5° 
should be subtracted. The 
values in degrees’ given 
inside the outer ring relate to 
the ‘azimuth’, i.e. the angle by 
which the apparent east-west 
movement of the sun is 
measured in its projection on 
the horizontal plane. The local 
times given in the outer ring 
correspond to the standard 
time for longitude 0° 
(Greenwich, i.e. the meridian 
of Greenwich Mean Time). 

At locations on degrees of 
longitude east of this, the local 
time is 4 min earlier, per 
degree of longitude, than the 
standard time. For every 
degree of longitude to the west 
of 0°, the local time is 4 min 
later than the standard time. 


Duration of sunshine 

The potential duration of 
sunshine per day is almost the 
same from 21 May to 21 July, 
i.e. 16-163/4h, and from 21 
November to 21 January, t.e. 
81/4-71/2h. In the months 
outside these dates, the 
duration of sunshine varies 
monthly by almost 2h. The 
effective duration of sunshine 
is barely 40% of the figures 
given above, owing to mist 
and cloud formation. This 
degree of efficacy varies 
considerably depending on 
the location. Exact information 
is available from the regional 
observation centres of the 
areas in question. 


Sun and heat 

The natural heat in the open 
air depends on the position of 
the sun and the ability of the 
surface of the Earth to give 
out heat. For this reason, the 
heat curve lags approx- 
imately 1 month behind the 
curve of solar altitude, i.e. the 
warmest day is not 21 June, 
but in the last days of July, 
and the coldest day is not 21 
December, but in the last days 
of January. Again, this pheno- 
menon is such that local 
conditions are extraordinarily 
varied.

to establish the duration of sunshine or shadow on a building at a particular time of

(3) Solar control double glazing 


Solar Control Double Glazing 

Solar control double glazing is characterised by a high light 
transmittance and an energy transmittance which is as low 
as possible. This is achieved by a very thin layer of precious 
metal deposited on the protected inside layer of one of the 
panes. Apart from its solar control qualities, solar control 
double glazing fulfils all the requirements of highly 
insulating double glazing, with k values up to 1.2W/m2K. 
The choice of a wide range of colours and colourless tones, 
augmented by the availability of colour-matched single- 
and double-glazed fagade panels, presents many design 
Opportunities. Solar control glass can be combined with 
sound-reduction glass, armoured glass, laminated glass, 
safety glass or ornamental/cast glass as either internal or 
external sheets. A combination with wired glass is not 
possible. 

Each glass type is identified by colour (as seen from the 
outside) as well as by a pair of values: the first is the light 
transmittance and the second the total energy 
transmittance, and both are given as percentages. Example: 
auresin (= blue) 40/26. 











GLASS 


Light transmittance T, in the 380-780 nm (nanometres) 
wavelength band, based on the light sensitivity of the 
human eye (%). 

Light reflection R, from outside and inside (%). 

Colour rendering index R,: 

R, >90 = very good colour rendering; 

R, >80 = good colour rendering. 

UV transmittance Tyy in the 320-2500nm wavelength 
band is the sum of the direct energy transmission and the 
secondary heat emission (= radiation and convection) 
towards the inside. 

The b value is the mean transmittance factor of the sun's 
energy based on an energy transmission of a 3mm thick 
single pane of glass of 87%. Accordingly: 

2 g(%) 
87% 
where g is the total energy transmittance. 

Selectivity code S. S = T,/g. A higher value for the 
selectivity code S shows a favourable relationship between 
light transmittance (T,) and the total energy transmittance 
(g). 

The thermal transmittance k of a glazing unit indicates 
how much energy is lost through the glass. The lower this 
value, the lower the heat loss. The k value of conventional! 
double-glazing units is greatly dependent on the distance 
between the two sheets of glass and the contents of the 
cavity (air or inert gas). With solar-control glass, an 
improved k value is achieved because of the precious metal 
layer. Standard k values are based on a glass spacing of 
12mm. 

Generally, colour rendering seems unaltered when 
looking through a glass window from inside a room. 
However, if a direct comparison is made between looking 
through the glass and through an open window, the slight 
toning produced by most glass is perceptible. Depending 
on the type of glass, this is usually grey or brown. This 
difference can also be seen when looking from outside a 
room through two panes set at a corner. The interior colour 
climate is only marginally effected by solar-control glazing 
since the spectral qualities of the daylight barely change. 
Colour rendering is expressed by the R index. 


Multifunctional Double-Glazing Units 

Owing to the increasing demands being placed on facade 
elements, glazing is required to provide a wide range of 
functions: thermal insulation, sound reduction, solar 
control, personal security, fire protection, aesthetic and 
design aspects, environmental protection and 
sustainability. These functions demand an increased 
protection element which cannot be provided by 
conventional double glazing. 

Multifunctional double-glazing units can combine 
several protection properties, and it is technically possible 
to fulfil almost all of those listed above. However, a 
Standard multifunctional double-glazing unit is not yet 
commercially available > @.

Toughened (tempered) glass 

Toughened safety glass is a pre-stressed glass. Pre-stressing 
is achieved by thermal treatment. The production method 
consists of rapid heating followed by rapid cooling with a 
blast of cold air. In comparison to float glass, which 
produces sharp, dagger-like glass splinters when broken, 
this glass breaks into small, mostly round-edged glass 
crumbs. The danger of injury is thus greatly reduced. 
Toughened glass has the further advantages of increased 
bending and impact-resistant qualities and tolerance to 
temperature change (150K temperature difference, and up 
to 300°C compared with 40°C for annealed material. It is also 
unaffected by sub-zero temperatures). Toughened glass also 
has enhanced mechanical strength (up to five times stronger 
than ordinary glass), so it can be used in structural glazing 
systems. Alterations to, and work on, toughened glass is not 
possible after production. Even slight damage to the surface 
results in destruction. However, tempered safety glass can 
be used in conventional double-glazing units > ). 

Areas of use: sports buildings (ball impact resistant); 
school and playschool buildings because of safety 
considerations; living and administration buildings for 
stairways, doors and partitions; near radiators to avoid 
thermal cracking; for fully glazed facades, and elements 
such as glazed parapets and balustrades on balconies and 
Staircases to prevent falls. 


Laminated glass 
During the manufacture of laminated glass, two or more 
panes of float glass are firmly bonded together with one or 
more highly elastic polyvinylbutyral (PVB) films. 
Alternatively, resin can be poured between two sheets of 
glass which are separated by spacers, and the resin is then 
cured. This process is called cast-in-place (CIP). The normal 
transparency of the glass may be slightly reduced 
depending on the thickness of the glass. Laminated glass is 
a non-splintering glass as the plastic film(s) hold the 
fragments of glass in place when the glass is broken, thus 
reducing the possibility of personal injury to a minimum. 
There are several categories of laminated glass: safety 
glass, anti-bandit glass, bullet-resistant glass, fire-resistant 
glass and sound-control glass. The thickness and the 
number of layers of glass, and the types of interlayer, are 
designed to produce the required properties. 





GLASS 


Laminated safety glass 
Laminated safety glass normally consists of two layers of 
glass bonded with polyvinylbutyral (PVB) foil. This is a 
standard product which is used to promote safety in areas 
where human contact and potential breakage are likely. The 
tear-resistant foil makes it difficult to penetrate the glass, 
thus giving enhanced security against breakage and break- 
in. Even when safety glass is broken, the security of the 
room Is maintained. Laminated safety glass is always used 
for overhead glazing for safety and security reasons > (2). 
Building regulations insist on its use in certain situations. 
Areas of use: glazed doors and patio doors; door side- 
lights; shops; all low-level glazing; balustrades; bathing and 
shower screens; anywhere that children play and may fall 
against the glass, or where there is a high traffic volume, 
e.g. entrance areas in community buildings, schools and 
playschools. 


Laminated anti-bandit glass 

Laminated anti-bandit glass is the most suitable material for 
providing complete security in protective glazing systems. 
Anti-bandit glass can be made with two glass layers of 
different thicknesses bonded with PVB foil, or with three or 
more glass layers of different glass thicknesses bonded 
with standard or reinforced PVB foil. Additional security can 
be provided by incorporating alarm bands, or wires 
connected to an alarm system. 

One side of this glass will withstand repeated blows from 
heavy implements such as bricks, hammers, crowbars, 
pickaxes etc. There may be crazing in the area of impact, but 
the tough, resilient PVB interlayers absorb the shock waves, 
Stop any collapse of the pane and prevent loose, flying 
fragments of glass. Even after a sustained attack, the glass 
continues to provide visibility and reassurance, as well as 
protection from the elements. Additional security can be 
achieved by bonding the glass to the framing members so 
that the frame and the glass cannot be separated during an 
attack. Normally, the side of the expected attack is the 
external side. Only in law courts should the side of the 
expected attack be on the inside. It is not permissible to 
change the orientation of the glazing without good reason. 

Areas of use: shops; display cases; museums; kiosks and 
ticket offices; banks; post offices; building societies; wages 
and rent offices; etc. 


Blast-resistant glass 

Safety and anti-bandit glass can also be used to provide 
protection against bomb attack and blast. The glass 
performs in two ways. First, it repels any bomb which is 
thrown at it, causing it to bounce back at the attacker, and 
second, under the effects of a blast it will deform and crack, 
but the glass pieces remain attached, reducing the 
likelihood of flying splinters. 


Bullet-resistant glass 
For protection against gunshots, a build-up of multiple layers 
Is required, the overall thickness (20-50 mm) depending on 
the classification required. This glass incorporates up to four 
layers of glass, some of different thicknesses, interlayered 
with PVB. When attacked, the outer layers on the side of the 
attack are broken by the bullet and absorb energy by 
becoming finely granulated. The inner layers absorb the shock 
waves. A special reduced-spalling grade of glass can be used 
to minimise the danger of glass fragments flying off from the 
rear face of the glass. Even after an attack, barrier protection is 
maintained and visibility (apart from the impact area) is 
unaffected. Bullet-resistant classifications are based on the type 
of weapon and calibre used, e.g. handgun, rifle or shotgun. 
Areas of use: banks; post offices; building societies; 
betting offices; wages and rent offices; cash desks: security 
vehicles; embassies; royal households: political and 
government buildings; airports; etc.

GLASS 


Fire-resistant glass 
Fire resistance can be built up in two ways. One is a 
laminated combination of Georgian wired glass and float 
glass (or safety or security glass) with a PVB interlayer. The 
other way is to incorporate a transparent intumescent layer 
between the pre-stressed borsilicate glass sheets which, 
when heated, swells to form an opaque, fire-resistant 
barrier. Fire resistance of up to 2h can be achieved. It must 
be remembered that in any given situation, the 
performance of the glazing depends on adequate support 
during the ‘period of stability’ prior to collapse. 

Areas of use: fire doors; partitions; staircase enclosures: 
rooflights and windows in hospitals; public buildings; 
schools; banks; computer centres; etc. (= pp. 130-31.) 


Structural glazing 

There is an increasing demand for large, uninterrupted 
areas of glass on facades and roofs, and it is now possible 
to use the structural properties of glass to support, suspend 
and stiffen large planar surfaces. Calculation of the required 
glass strengths, thicknesses, support systems and fittings to 
combat structural and wind stresses has become a very 
specialised area (consult the glass manufacturer). A wide 
variety of glass types may be used, e.g. toughened and 
laminated, single and double glazed, with solar control or 
with thermal recovery twin glass walls. Panels as large as 
2m x 4.2m are possible. These are attached at Only four, six 
or eight points and can be glazed in any plane, enabling 
flush glazing to sweep up walls and slopes and over roofs 
in One continuous surface. Various systems have been used 
to create stunning architectural effects on prestigious 
buildings throughout the world, even in areas which are 
prone to earthquakes, typhoons and_ hurricanes. 
Dimensional tolerances tend to be very small. For example, 
in a project for an art gallery in Bristol, UK, a tolerance of +2 
mm across an entire frameless glass facade 90m long and 
9m high has been achieved. The 2.7m x 1.7m glass facade 
panels are entirely supported on 600mm wide structural 
glass fins. 


Sound-control glass — () -@) 

Compared with monolithic glass of the same total 
thickness, all laminated glass specifications provide an 
increased degree of sound control and a more consistent 
acoustic performance. The multiple construction dampens 
the coincident effect found in window glass, thus offering 
better sound reduction at higher frequencies, where the 
human ear is particularly sensitive. The cast-in-place type of 
lamination is particularly effective in reducing sound 
transmittance. 

Sealed multiple-glazed insulating units and double 
windows, particularly when combining thick float glass (up 
to a maximum of 25 mm) and thinner glass, effectively help 
to dampen sound. 

Areas of use: windows and partitions in offices; public 
buildings; concert halls; etc. 


Other types of glass 

There are other types of glass which have been developed 
especially for certain situations. Shielding glass has a 
special coating to provide electronic shielding. Ultra-violet 
light-control glass has a special interlayer which reflects up 
to 98% of UV rays in sunlight. Various mirror-type glasses 
are used in surveillance situations, e.g. one-way glass 
(which requires specific lighting conditions) or Venetian 
striped mirrors with strips of silvering (any lighting 
conditions).

Gi) Cast glass combinations 


The term cast glass is given to machine-produced glass 
which has been given a surface texture by rolling. It is not 
clearly transparent > (). Cast glass is used where clear 
transparency in not desired (bathroom, WC) and where a 
decorative effect is required. The ornamental aspects of 
cast glass are classified as clear and coloured ornamental 
glass, clear crude glass, clear and coloured wired glass, and 
clear and coloured ornamental wired glass. Almost all 
commercially available cast glass can be used in double- 
glazing units > (A). 

Normally, the structured side is placed outside in order 
to ensure a perfect edge seal. So that double-glazing units 
may be cleaned easily, the structured side is placed towards 
the cavity. This is possible only with lightly structured glass. 
Do not combine coloured cast glass with other coloured 
glasses such as float, armoured or laminated glass, or with 
coated, heat-absorbing or reflective glass.

Glass entrance screens consist of one or several glass 
doors, and the side and top panels. Other possibilities are 
sliding, folding, arched and half-round headed entrance 
screens. Various colours and glass structures are available. 
The dimensions of the doors are the same as those of the

disintegrates into a network of small crumbs which loosely 
hang together. Normal glass thicknesses of 10 or 12mm are 
used, and stiffening ribs may be necessary, depending on 
the structural requirements.

GLASS 
Glass Blocks 


Glass blocks are hollow units which consist of two sections 
melted and pressed together, thereby creating a sealed air 
cavity. Both surfaces can be made smooth and transparent, 
or very ornamental and almost opaque. Glass blocks can be 
obtained in different sizes, coated on the inside or outside, 
uncoated, or made of coloured glass. They can be used 
internally and externally, e.g. transparent screen walls and 
room dividers (also in gymnastic and sports halls), 
windows, lighting strips, balcony parapets and terrace 
walls. Glass blocks are fire-resistant up to G 60 or G 120 
when used as a Cavity wall with a maximum uninterrupted 
area of 3.5m?, and can be built either vertically or 
horizontally. Glass blocks cannot be used in a load-bearing 
Capacity. 

Properties: good sound and thermal insulation; high 
light transmittance (up to 82%), depending on the design; 
can have translucent, light scattering and low dazzle 
properties; can also have enhanced resistance to impact 
and breakage. A glass block wall has good insulation 
properties: with cement mortar, k = 3.2W/m2K: with 
lightweight mortar, k = 2.9W/m2K.

GLASS 


Profiled glass is cast glass produced with a U-shaped 
profile. It is translucent, with an ornamentation on the 
outside surface of the profile, and conforms to the 
properties of cast glass. 

Low maintenance requirements. Suitable for lift shafts 
and roof glazing. Rooms using this glass for fenestration 
are rendered dazzle-free. 

Special types: Profilit-bronze, Cascade, Topas, Amethyst. 
Heat-absorbing glass Reglit and Profilit ‘Plus 1.7’ attain a k 
value of 1.8 W/m2K. 

Solar-control glass (Type R, ‘Bernstein’; Type P, ‘Antisol’), 
which reflects and/or absorbs ultra-violet and infra-red 
radiation, can be used to protect delicate goods which are 
sensitive to UV radiation. The transmission of radiant 
energy into the room is reduced, as is the convection from 
the glazing, whilst the light transmission is maintained. 

For glazing subject to impacts, e.g. in sports halls, 
Regulit SP2 or Profilit K22/60/7 without wire reinforcement 
should be used. 

Regulit and Profilit are allowed as fire-resistant glass A 
30. Normal and special profiles are also available reinforced 
with longitudinal wires.

Q) Glazing with fire-protection class G 


Fire-resistant glass 

Normal glass is of only limited use for fire protection. In 
cases of fire, float glass cracks in a very short time due to 
the one-sided heating, and large pieces of glass fall out 
enabling the fire to spread. The increasing use of glass in 
multistorey buildings for fagades, parapets and partitions 
has led to increased danger in the event of fire. In order to 
comply with building regulations, the fire resistance of 
potentially threatened glazing must be adequate. The level 
of fire resistance of a glass structure is classified by its 
resistance time: i.e. 30, 60, 90, 120 or 180min. The fire 
resistance time is the number of minutes that the structure 
prevents the fire and combustion gasses from passing 
through. The construction must be officially tested, 
approved and certificated — (1). 

Fire-resistant glass comes in four forms: wired glass with 
point-welded mesh, maximum _ resistance 60-90min: 
special armoured glass in a laminated combination with 
double-glazing units; pre-stressed borosilicate glass, e.g. 
Pyran; multi-laminated panes of float glass with clear 
intumescent interlayers which turn opaque on exposure to 
fire, e.g. Pyrostop. (> pp. 130-31) 


Glass blocks with steel reinforcement 

Fire-resistant, steel-reinforced glass blocks can, as with all 
other glass block walls, be fixed to the surrounds with or 
without U sections. All other types of fixing methods are 
also applicable. Because of the strongly linear spread of fire 
and the production of combustion gases, fire-resistant glass 
block walls should be lined all round with mineral fibre 
slabs (stonewool) -> @).

GLASS 


Sound reduction 
Because of its weight, a glass block wall has particularly 
good sound insulation properties: 

1.00kN/m2 with 80mm glass blocks; 

1.25kN/m2 with 100mm glass blocks; 

1.42kN/m2 with special BSH glass blocks. 

To be effective, the surrounding building elements must 
have at least the same sound reduction characteristics. 
Glass block construction is the ideal solution in all cases 
where good sound insulation is required. In areas where a 
high level of sound reduction is necessary, economical 
solutions can be achieved by using glass block walls to 
provide the daylight while keeping ventilation Openings and 
windows. These can serve as secondary escape routes if 
they conform to the minimum allowable size. 

Follow the relevant regulations with regard to sound 
reduction where the standards required for particular areas 
can be found. The sound reduction rating (R'w) can be 
calculated from the formula R'w = LSM + 52dB (where LSM 
is the reduction value of airborne sound) > (5). Single-skin 
glass block walls can meet the requirements of sound 
reduction level 5 > ©.

PLASTICS 


Plastics, as raw material (fluid, powdery or granular), are divided into 
three categories: (1) thermosetting plastics (which harden when heated): 
(2) thermoplastics (which become plastic when heated): (3) elastomers 
(which are permanently elastic). Plastics are processed industrially using 
chemical additives, fillers, glass fibres and colorants to produce semi- 
finished goods, building materials, finished products» (1) - 6). 

The beneficial characteristics of plastics in construction include: water 
and corrosion resistance, low maintenance, low weight, colouring runs 
throughout the material, high resistance to light (depending on the type), 
applications providing a durable colour finish on other materials (e.g. as 
a film for covering steel and plywood » () etc.). They are also easy to 
work and process, can be formed almost without limits, and have low 
thermal conductivities. 

Double-skinned webbed sections are available in a wide range of 
thicknesses, widths and lengths. Being translucent, these sections are 
suitable for roof or vertical glazing. These are permeable to light» (3). 

The large number of trade names can be bewildering so designers 
must refer to the international chemical descriptions and symbols when 
selecting plastics, to ensure that their properties match those laid down 
in standards, test procedures and directives. The key plastics in 
construction, and their accepted abbreviations, are: 


ABS = acrylonitrile- PC = polycarbonate 
butadiene-styrene PE = polyethylene 
CR = chloroprene PIB = polyisobutylene 
EP = epoxy resin PMMA = polymethy! 
EPS = expanded polystyrene methacrylate (acrylic 
GRP = glass fibre-reinforced glass) 
plastic PP = polypropylene 
GR-UP = glass fibre-reinforced PS = polystyrene 
polyester PVC = polyvinyl chloride, 
IIR = butyl rubber hard or soft 
MF = melamine formaldehyde UP = unsaturated polyester 
PA = polyamide resin 


The plastics used to produce semi-finished materials and finished 
components contain, as a rule, up to 50% filling material, reinforcement 
and other additives. They are also significantly affected by temperature 
SO an in-service temperature limit of between 80° and 120° should be 
observed. This in not a serious problem given that sustained heating to 
above 80° is found only in isolated spots in buildings (e.g., perhaps 
around hot water pipes and fires). Plastics, being organic materials, are 
flammable. Some are classed as a flame inhibiting structural material: 
most of them are normally flammable; however, a few are classed as 
readily flammable. The appropriate guidelines contained in the regional 
building regulations for the application of flammable structural materials 
in building structures must be followed.

Construction using plastics is best planned in the form of panel structures 
(shells). These have the advantage of very low weight, thus reducing 
loading on the substructure, and also offer the possibility of prefabricated 
construction > (14 - @/. Structures in plastics (without the use of other 
materials) at present only bear their own weight plus snow and wind 
loads, and possibly additional loads due to lighting. This allows large 
areas to be covered more easily — (9) - @2.

SKYLIGHTS AND DOME ROOFLIGHTS 


Domes, skylights, coffers, smoke vents and louvres, as fixed or 
moving units, can be used for lighting and ventilation, and for 
clearing smoke from rooms, halls, stair wells etc. All these can 
be supplied in heat-reflecting Plexiglas if required. 

By directing the dome towards the north (in the northern 
hemisphere), sunshine and glare are avoided — @). The use of 
high curb skylights -» 2) will reduce glare because of the sharp 
angles of incidence of the sunlight. Dome rooflights used for 
ventilation should face into the prevailing wind in order to 
utilise the extraction capacity of the wind. The inlet aperture 
should be 20% smaller than the outlet aperture. Forced 
ventilation, with an air flow of 150-1000 m3/h, can be achieved 
by fitting a fan into the curb of a skylight > @. Dome rooflights 
can also be used for access to the roof. 

Attention should be given to the aerodynamic extraction 
surfaces of smoke exhaust systems. Orientating each extraction 
unit at an angle of 90° from the adjacent one will allow for wind 
coming from all directions. Position to leeward/windward if 
pairs of extraction fans are to be mounted in line with or against 
the direction of the prevailing wind. 

Smoke extraction vents are required for stair wells more 
than four complete storeys high. Variable skylight aperture 
widths up to 5.50m are available, as is a special version up to 
7.50m wide which does not need extra support. 

Skylight systems offer diffuse room lighting which is free 
from glare > (@4. North-facing skylights with spun glass fibre 
inlays guarantee all the technically important advantages of a 
workshop illuminated by a north light > 43. Traditional flat roofs 
can be modified to admit a north light by inserting skylights 
with curbs.

WINDOWS: SIZES 


If daylight is considered to be essential for the use to which 
a room will be put, then windows are an unavoidable 
necessity. Simple apertures for daylight have developed 
into significant stylistic features, from Romanesque semi- 
circular arched windows to Baroque windows surrounded 
by rich, elaborate decoration. In the European cultural 
region lying north of the Alps, window forms reveal 
particularly strong features. In contrast to the climatically 
favoured cultural region of the Mediterranean, daily life 
here mainly had to be spent indoors. The people were thus 
dependent upon daylight because artificial light was 
expensive and good illumination of a room during the 
hours of darkness was beyond the means of most of the 
local population. 

Every work area needs a window leading to the outside 
world. The window area which transmits light must be at 
least '/20 of the surface area of the floor in the work space. 
The total width of all the windows must amount to at least 
1/10 of the total width of all the walls, i.e. 1/10 (M + N + O + P) 
> >. 

For workrooms which are 3.5m or more high, the light 
transmission surface of the window must be at least 30% of 
the outside wall surface, i.e. > 0.3 A x B > ©. 

For workrooms with dimensions similar to those of a 
living room, the following rules should be applied. 

Minimum height of the glass surface, 1.3m — ©). 

Height of the window breast from the ground, > 0.9m. 

The total height of all windows must be 50% of the width 
of the workroom, i.e. Q = 0.5R > @. 


Example — (5) When __ calculating —ithe 
A Fora flat, angle of incidence of window size for a living

B Necessary window size for the 
fing toor the room and the angle of 


C 17% of the room floor surface area 
is sufficient for the size of 
the windows. 

The slope of the roof surface 
is known. A skylight with a slope 
of 0° needs to be only 20% of the 
size of a vertical window to make 
the room equally bright - however, 
there is no view. Windows are 
generally the poorest point in 
terms of heat insulation. For this 
reason, it is convenient to fit the 
room with smaller windows, as long 
as the solar heat gain through the 
windows is discounted. 

As well as the window size and 
the slope of the window surface, 
the siting of the house plays an 
important role. A free-standing 
house admits more light with the 
same surface area of windows than 
a house in the city centre. 


Example . 6)-@ 


A Slope of a roof window of 40° 

B The house is not free standing, 
but is also not in heavy shadow 

C 10% of the room floor surface area 
is sufficient for the size of the 
windows. 





@) Roof window 


incidence of the light must 
be taken into account — (). 
Here, ‘a’ is the minimum 
window size for a living 
room as a percentage of the 
floor area of the room, ‘b’ is 
the minimum size for a 
kitchen window and ‘c’ is 
the minimum size for all 
other rooms. The angle of 
incidence of the light is ‘d’. 
The larger the angle of 
incidence, the larger the 
windows need to be. This is 
because the closer the 
neighbouring houses are, 
and the higher they are, the 
greater the angle of 
incidence and the smaller 
the amount of _— light 
penetrating into the house. 
Larger windows will com- 
pensate for this smaller 
quantity of light. 

Dutch regulations stip- 
ulate the sizes of windows 
in relation to the angle of 
incidence of the light.

WINDOWS: SHADING 


Protection measures must 
prevent glare and regulate 


the inflow of heat from 
sunlight. In temperate 
climates, large window 


apertures with a high but 
diffuse incidence of light 
are preferred, whereas in 
hot climates, small window 
apertures still allow 
sufficient light to enter. 

Venetian blinds >» 43 
(with flat slats of wood, 
aluminium or plastic), roller 
shutters, roller blinds and 
partially angled sun blinds 
are all useful and can be 
adjusted as required. Fixed 
external devices are clearly 
less flexible than retractable 
or adjustable ones. Vertical 
panel blinds — (5) (either 
fixed or pivoting around the 
axis of the slat) are also 
Suitable for tall or angled 
window surfaces. 

Heat rising up the face of 
a building should be able to 
escape, and not be blocked 
by external sun screens or 
allowed to enter’ the 
building via open skylights. 

Internal shades are less 
effective than external ones 
for reducing solar heat gain 





because the heat they 
absorb is released into the 
room.

LOFT WINDOWS 


In planning the size of windows, the optimum daylight level 
relative to the purpose of the room must be the deciding 
factor. For instance, building regulations require a 
minimum window area of 1'/s of the floor surface area for 
living rooms = @. 

Large windows make living rooms more comfortable. 
The window width in secondary rooms can be chosen 
according to the distance between the rafters. Generously 
wide windows in living rooms can be achieved by the 
inclusion of rafter trimmers. Steeper roofs need shorter 
windows, while flatter roofs require longer windows. Roof 
windows can be joined using purpose-made prefabricated

WINDOWS: CONSTRUCTION 


Any window design must satisfy the technical 
requirements of the relevant parts of the building. The 
main considerations are the size, format, divisions, way of 
opening, frame material and surface’ treatment. 
Ventilation, thermal and sound insulation, fire resistance 
and general safety issues, including the use of security 
glazing, must also be taken into account. The design of the 
sections and the location and type of sealing are of great 
importance in guaranteeing a long-lasting water- and 
draught-proof seal. Built-in components such as roller 
shutter boxes, window sills and vents must match the 
noise insulation of the windows — (0 - @2 as well as other

WINDOWS: CLEANING 


Safety belts with straps, safety cables or safety apparatus 
for working at heights should be used as a protection 
against falls > (4). 

Facade hoists and mobile equipment (allowing access to 
fixed glazing) for cleaning windows and facades - (8) - (1) 
are available to carry out maintenance and repair work 
(thus saving the cost of scaffolding). If fitted at the right 
time, they can be used to carry out minor building work 
(such as fixing blinds, installing windows etc.). With slight 
modifications, fagade hoists and access equipment can be 
used as rescue apparatus in the event of a fire. The options 
available include mobile suspended ladders mounted on 
Mobile safety cradle and Parallel travel safety ladders rails, trackless roof gantry equipment with a cradle, and a 
safety belt (for 3 or 4 storeys) rail-mounted roof gantry with a cradle and attached to the 
roof deck or the balustrade. 

Suspended aluminium ladder equipment (for facade 
access) — (2) consists of a suspended mobile ladder on rails. 
The width of the ladder is 724mm or 840mm, and the total 
overall length is 25m maximum, depending on the shape of 
the building. The maximum safe working load (S.W.L.) is 
200 kg (i.e. two men and the apparatus itself). Alternatives 
are available, such as maintenance gangways — (5) and 
cleaning balconies > ©).

Internal doors must be positioned in order to maximise the 
usable room space > (1)- ©). It is necessary to decide whether a 
door should open inwards or outwards. Normally doors open 
into the room - @5). Door types are named according to their 
construction, position and purpose. A balanced door » @3) + @4) 
requires little strength to open it, and is well suited for corridors. 

The width of a door is determined by its use and the room 
into which it leads. The minimum inside width of a door 
opening is 55cm. In residential buildings the standard door 
opening widths are as follows. Single-panel doors: main rooms 
approx. 80cm; auxiliary rooms approx. 70cm; front doors to 
flats approx. 90cm; front doors to houses up to 115cm. Double 
doors: main rooms approx. 170cm; front doors 140-225cm. 
Door opening height at least 185cm, but normally 195-200cm. 
Sliding and revolving doors are not permitted for escape or exit 
doors, as they could block the route in an emergency. 

Disabled persons have special requirements. The minimum 
convenient door width for the ambulant disabled is 80cm. This 
is too narrow for wheelchair users, but 90cm is usually 
adequate. There should be adequate space to position a 
wheelchair beside the door. Corridors should be not less than 
120cm wide so that wheelchair users can position themselves 
to open a door in the end wall of a corridor or at the side. An 
end door should be offset to give maximum space beside the 
handle. Similarly, when a door is located in the corner of a 
room, it should be hinged at the side nearer the corner — @5, 25)

LOCKING SYSTEMS 


Cylinder locks offer the greatest security, for it is virtually 
impossible to open them with tools. The cylinder lock 
developed by Linus Yale is very different from other locking 
systems. There are profile, oval, round and half cylinder 
locks. Cylinder locks are supplied with extensions as 
necessary On one or both sides, increasing in increments of 
omm, to suit the thickness of the door -> ©). 

During the planning and ordering phase for a locking 
system, a locking plan is drawn up which includes a unique 
security certificate. Replacement keys are only supplied 
after production of this document. 


Combination key systems 

With a combination key system, the key of the entrance 
door to each flat also opens all doors to shared facilities as 
well as shared access doors, e.g. courtyard, basement or 
main front door. This is suitable for houses with multiple 
family occupancy or estate houses = (1). 


Master key systems 

In a master key system, a principal pass key opens all locks 
throughout the complete system. This is suitable for single 
family occupancy houses, schools and restaurants. 


Central key systems 

With a central key system, several combination key systems 
are combined. This is suitable for blocks of flats > ©@). 
Separate keys unlock the front door to each flat and to all 
shared facilities. In addition, there is a master key which 
unlocks all the shared doors in the blocks. 


General master key systems 

A general master key system consists of multiple master 
key systems. The general master key allows one person 
access to all rooms. It is possible to subdivide areas by 
using main and group keys. Each cylinder has its own 
individual lock and, with the exception of the correct master 
(Or pass) key, can only be opened with its own key. 

This system is suitable for factories, commercial 
premises, airports and hotels > @. Vulnerable points which 
should be taken into account during the planning stage are 
set out in > ©).

(4) Security in the industrial and community sectors 





The term ‘security technology’ is to be understood as 
covering all devices used for defence against criminal 
danger to the body, life or valuables. In reality, all parts of 
a building can be penetrated, even those made of steel 
and reinforced concrete. The need for security should be 
established by an in-depth study of vulnerable areas, with 
an estimate of costs and benefits. The police will advise 
on the choice of security and monitoring system 
equipment. 

Mechanical protection devices are constructional 
measures which provide mechanical resistance to an 
intruder. These can only be overcome by the use of force, 
which will leave physical traces behind. An important 
consideration is the effectiveness of this resistance. Such 
measures are necessary for the main entrance doors, 
windows and basement entrances in blocks of flats, and 
display windows, entrances, other windows, skylights 
and fences in business premises. Mechanical protection 
devices include steel grilles, either fixed or as roller 
shutters, safety roller shutters, secure locks and chains. 
Wire-reinforced glass also has a deterrent effect, and 
acrylic or polycarbonate window panes offer enhanced 
protection. 

Electrical security devices will automatically set off an 
alarm if any unauthorised entry to the protected premises 
is attempted. An important consideration is the time 
taken from when the alarm ts triggered until the arrival of 
security staff or the police. 


(1) Burglar and attack alarm systems help to monitor and 
protect people, property and goods. They cannot prevent 
intruders entering premises, but they should give the 
earliest possible warning of such an attempt. Optimum 
security can only be achieved by mechanical protection 
and the sensible installation of burglar alarm systems. 
Supervisory measures include monitoring the outside of 
the building, as well as each room and individual objects 
of value, security traps and emergency alarm calls. 

Fire alarm systems give an early warning of smoke or 
fire, and may also alert the emergency services. Fire 
alarm systems are there to protect people and property. 


(2) Outdoor supervision systems are used to monitor 
areas around the building. They increase security by 
recording all nearby activity, usually up to and including 
the property boundary. They consist of mechanical or 
constructional measures, electronic or other detection 
devices, and/or organisational or personnel action. Their 
Objective is legal fencing, to deter or delay intruders, or 
to detect and give early warning about unauthorised 
people or vehicles. This also includes the detection and 
identification of possible sabotage attempts or 
espionage. Mechanical measures include construction 
work, fences, ditches, walls, barriers, gates, access 
control and lighting. Electrical measures can involve 
control centres, detectors, video/television sensors, an 
access control system, an alarm connected to higher 
communication systems, an automatic telephone dialling 
device and/or radio. Organisational actions include the 
briefing of personnel, observation, surveillance, security, 
task forces, technical staff, watchdogs and an emergency 
action plan. 


(3) Goods protection systems, also called shoplifting 
protection systems, are electronic systems which serve to 
protect against theft and the illegal removal of goods 
from a controlled area during normal business hours.

STAIRS 


Calculations for the construc- 
tion of stairs, ramps and 
guards are set out In various 
national building regulations. 
In the UK, British Standards 
and the Building Regulations 
should be consulted (see 
Approved Document K). The 
guidelines here are based on 
German standards. 

Dwellings with no more 
than two flats must have an 
effective stair width of at least 
0.80m and 17/29 rise-to-tread 
ratio. Stairs which are not 
strictly covered by building 
regulations may be as little as 
0.50m wide and have a 21/21 
ratio. Stairs governed by 
building regulations must 
have a width of 1.00m and a 
ratio of 17/28. In high rise flats 
they must be 1.25m wide. 
The length of stair runs from 
>3 steps up to <18 steps = (5). 
Landing length = n times the 
length of stride + 1 depth of 
step (e.g. with a rise-to-tread 
ratio of 17/29 = 1 x 63 + 29 = 
92 cm or 2 x 63 + 29 = 1.55 m). 
Doors opening into’ the 
stairwell must not restrict the 
effective width. 

The time required for 
complete evacuation must be 
calculated for stair widths in 
public buildings or theatres. 
Such staircases or front 
entrance steps are climbed 
slowly, so they can have a 
more gradual ascent. A 
staircase at a side entrance or 
emergency stairs should 
make a rapid descent easy.

STAIRS 


The experiences one has of 
ascending and descending 
stairs varies greatly with the 
stair design, for example 
there is a_ significant 
difference between an 
interior domestic design 
and a grand flight of 
entrance steps. Climbing 
Stairs takes on average 
seven times as = much 
energy as walking on the 
flat. From the physiological 
point of view, the best use 
of ‘climbing effort’ is with 
an angle of incline of 30° 
and a ratio of rise of: 

rise of step, r _ 17 
going of step, g 29 
The angle of rise is 
determined by the length of 
an adult’s stride (about 
61-64cm). To arrive at the 
optimum rise, which takes 
the least energy, the 
following formula can be 
applied: 

2r+g = 63cm (1 stride) 
In the dimensioning and 
design of flights of stairs, 
the function and purpose of 
the staircase is of primary 
importance, taking in the 
factors mentioned above. 

Not only is the gaining of 
height important, but also 
the way that the height is 
gained. For front door steps 
in frequent use, low steps of 
16 x 30cm are preferable. 
However, stairs in a work- 
place, or emergency stairs, 
should enable height to be 
gained rapidly. Every main 
staircase must be set in its 
Own continuous stairwell, 
which together with its 
access routes and exit to 
the open air, should be 
designed and arranged so 
as to ensure its safe use as 
an emergency exit. The 
width of the exit should be > 
the width of the staircase. 

The stairwell of at least 
one of the emergency 
staircases or fire exits must 
be < 35m from every part of 
a habitable room_ or 
basement. When several 
Staircases are necessary, 
they must be placed so as 
to afford the _ shortest 
possible escape route. 
Stairwell openings to the 
basement, unconverted 
lofts, workshops, shops, 
storerooms and_= similar 
rooms must be fitted with 
self-closing fire doors with 
a fire rating of 30 minutes.

Maximum — space iS 
required at hip (handrail) 
level, but at foot level 


considerably less is needed 
so the width at string level 
can be reduced, allowing 
more space for the stairwell. 

Staggering the handrail 
and string allows better 
structural fixing. A good 
string and handrail arrange- 
ment with a 12cm space 
between stairwell strings is 
shown in @). An additional 
handrail for children (height 
about 60 cm) is also shown, 
along with some _ less 
popular string and handrail 
positions. 

Circles in theatres, choir 
lofts, galleries and 
balconies must have a 
protective guard rail (height 
h). This is compulsory 
wherever there is a height 
difference in levels of 1m or 
more. 

For a drop of <12m, h= 
0.90m 

For a drop of >12m, h= 
1.10m 

Loft ladders have an 
angle of 45—-55°. However, if 
user requirements stipulate 
a Stair-like access (e.g. 
where loads are carried and 
available length is too short 
for a flight of normal stairs), 
then alternating tread stairs 
may be designed = 4). 
There should be a 
minimum number of risers 
for this type of stair (riser 
< 20 cm). Here ‘the sum of 
the goings + twice the rise = 
630mm’ is achieved by 
shaping the treads; goings 
are measured (staggered) at 
the axes a and b > (42, of the 
right and left foot.

These guidelines are based on recommendations issued by 
the German Federations of Trade Associations. In the UK, 
reference is usually made to BS EN 115: 1995: Safety rules 
for the construction and installation of escalators and 
passenger conveyors. 

Escalators — () - @) are required to provide continuous 
mass transport of people. (They are not designated as 
‘stairs’ in the provision of emergency escape.) Escalators, 
for example, in department stores rise at an angle of 
between 30° and 35°. The 35° escalator is more economical, 
as it takes up less surface area if viewed in plan but for large 
ascents, the 30° escalator is preferred both on psychological 
as well as safety grounds. The transportation capacity is 
about the same with both. 

Escalators in public transport installations are subject to 
stringent safety requirements (for function, design and 
safety) and should have angles of ascent of 27-28°. The 
angle of rise is the ratio 3/16, which is that of a gentle 
staircase. 

In accordance with a worldwide standard, the width of 
the step to be used is 60cm (for one-person width), 80cm 
(for one- to two-people width) and 100cm (for two-people 
width) + @-@). A 100cm step width provides ample space 
for people carrying loads. 

A flat section with a depth of >2.50m (minimum of two 
horizontal goings) should be provided at the access and exit 
points of the escalator. 

In department stores, office and administration 
buildings, exhibition halls and airports the speed of travel 
should, as a rule, be no greater than 0.5m/s, with a 
minimum of three horizontal exit goings. For underground 
stations and public transport facilities, 0.65 m/s is preferred. 

The average split of traffic that goes upstairs in a large 
department store is: 


fixed stairs 2% 
lifts 8% 
escalators 90% 


Coming down, about three-quarters of the traffic uses the 
escalators. 

According to current assessments, on average one 
escalator is installed for every 1500 m2 of sales area; but this 
average should be reduced to an optimum of 500-700 m2.

Travelators (or moving pavements) are a means of 
conveying people horizontally or up a slightly inclined 
plane (up to a maximum angle of 12°, or 21%). The big 
advantage of the travelator lies in its ability to transport 
prams, invalid chairs, shopping trolleys, bicycles and 
L unwieldy packages with only a slight risk of accident. At the 
planning stage the expected traffic must be carefully 
calculated, so that the installation provides the best 
conveying capacity possible. This capacity depends on the 
clear width available, the speed of travel and the load factor. 

with cleated belt The number of people transported can be as high as

travelators is normally 0.5-0.6m/s although where the 
inclination angle is less than 4° they can sometimes be run 
a little faster, up to 0.75m/s. Long travelators can be up to 
250m in length but shorter runs (e.g. about 30m long) are 
Plan view —> (7) better because they allow people to access and exit to and 
from the sides. It is therefore sensible to plan a series of 
smaller travelators. 

The advantage of the reversible travelators is their ability 
to offer both horizontal directions of travel = @) - 40, in 
@) Section of a reversible travelator -> contrast to > @ - @). The low height required for 
construction (this being only 180mm) allows these 
travelators to be fitted into existing buildings. 

The cotangents of the travelator gradient are: 

Gradient W(°) 10° 11° 12° 

cot W 5.6713 5.1446 4.7036 

Horizontal length L = cotan W x conveyor lift

LIFTS 


The upward and downward movement of people in newly 
erected multistorey buildings is principally achieved by lifts. An 
architect will normally call in an expert engineer to plan lift 
installations. The guidelines given here are based on German 
standards. In the UK, lift installation is covered by BS 5655, 
which contains recommendations from CEN (Committee for 
European Normalisation) and the International Standards 
Organisation. It is anticipated that future standards relating to 
lifts will be fully international in their scope. 

In larger, multistorey buildings it is usual to locate the lifts at 
a central pedestrian circulation point. Goods lifts should be kept 
separate from passenger lifts; though their use for carrying 
passengers at peak periods should be taken into account at the 
planning stage. 

The following maximum loads are stipulated for passenger 
lifts in blocks of flats: 


400kg (small lift) for use by passengers with hand 
baggage only 

630kg (medium lift) for use by passengers with prams 
and wheelchairs 

can also accommodate stretchers, 
coffins, furniture and wheelchairs 
> 

Lobbies in front of lift shaft entrances must be designed and 
arranged so that: (1) the users entering or exiting the lifts, even 
those carrying hand baggage, do not get in each other’s way 
more than is absolutely necessary; and (2) the largest loads to 
be carried by the lift in question (e.g. prams, wheelchairs, 
stretchers, coffins and furniture) can be manoeuvred in and out 
without risk of injuring people or damaging the building and the 
lift itself. Other users should be not be obstructed by the loads 
more than is absolutely necessary. 

For a lobby in front of a single lift: (1) the available minimum 
depth between the wall of the lift shaft door and the opposite 
wall, measured in the direction of the lift car, must be at least 
the same as the depth of the lift car itself; and (2) the minimum 
area available should be at least the same as the product of the 
depth of the lift car depth and the width of shaft. 

For a lobby in front of lifts with adjacent doors the available 
minimum depth between the shaft door wall and the opposite 
wall, measured in the direction of the lift car depth, should be at 
least the same as the depth of the deepest lift car.

LIFTS 


For Offices, Banks, Hotels etc. and 
Hospital Bed Lifts 


The building and its function dictate the basic type of lifts which 
need to be provided. They serve as a means of vertical transport 
for passengers and patients. 

Lifts are mechanical installations which are required to have 
a long service life (anything from 25 to 40 years). They should 
therefore be planned in such a way that even after 10 years they 
are still capable of meeting the increased demand. Alterations 
to installations that have been badly or too-cheaply planned can 
be expensive or even completely impossible. During the 
planning stage the likely usage should be closely examined. Lift 
sets normally form part of the main stairwell. 


Analysis of use: types and definitions 

Turn-round time is a calculated value indicating the time which 

a lift requires to complete a cycle with a given type of traffic. 
Average waiting time is the time between the button being 

pressed and the arrival of the lift car: 


cycle time (s) 


average waiting time (s) 
number of lifts/set 


il 


Transportation capacity is the maximum achievable carrying 
capacity (in passengers) within a five minute (300s) period: 


300(s) x car load (passengers) 


transportation capacity = 
cycle time (s) x no. of lifts 
Transportation capacity expressed in percent: 


100 x transportation capacity

for transporting small goods, 
documents, food etc.; not for 
use by passengers. The shaft 
framework is normally made 
of steel sections set in the 
shaft pit or on the floor, and 
clad on all sides by non- 
flammable building materials. 
+ (@) - © Dimensions and 
load-carrying capacity »> (7). 
The following formula is 
used to estimate the time, in 
seconds, of one transport 
cycle: 
2h 
Vv 


Le + B, + H (t, + ty) 

where 

2 constant factor for the

h = height of the lift (m) 

v = operating speed (m/s) 

B,= loading and unloading

With single doors t, = 6s; with 
double doors, 10s; with 
vertical sliding doors for

Under building regulations, 
the lift motor room must be 
lockable, have — sufficient 
illumination and be of a size 
such that maintenance can be 
carried out safely. The height 
of the area for the lift motor 
must be =1.8m. 

For food lifts in hospitals, 
the lift shafts must have 
washable smooth _ internal 
walls. 

An external push-button 
control must be provided for 
calling and despatching the 
lift to/from each stopping 
point. 

Larger goods lifts may be

PANORAMIC GLASS LIFTS 


Panoramic lifts are available in a variety of cabin shapes 
(1) - ©) and a carrying capacity of 400-1500kg (5-20 
passengers). There are several possible drive systems and 
nominal speeds, depending on the height of the building 
and requirements for comfort: 0.4, 0.63, 1.0m/s with a three- 
phase a.c. drive; and 0.25-1.0m/s with a hydraulic drive. 
Construction materials used are glass and steel — polished, 
brushed or with high gloss finish — brass and bronze. 

The panoramic lift enjoys great popularity. This applies 
both to external lifts on the facades of imposing business 
premises from which passengers can enjoy the view, and 

| a internal lifts in department stores or in foyers of large 
Push cee ° hotels where they look out on to the sales floors and 
a displays. » @-@ 
Stairlifts 
Stairlifts allow people with impaired mobility to move 
between floors with ease. They can be used on straight or 
curved stairways, and traverse landings. Aesthetics and 
maintenance of the rail mechanism must be given careful 
consideration during design and installation. In the UK, BS 
5776: 1996 Powered stairlifts defines the requirements for 
such lift installations in domestic properties as well as in 
other buildings.

RENOVATION OF OLD BUILDINGS 


Repairing, modernising, converting or adding structural 
extensions to an old building requires a different approach 
to the design process than for new buildings. It should be 
remembered that old buildings are often protected by law 
(e.g. listed buildings in the UK). 

The first task in any renovation project is a thorough 
survey of the existing structure, in which every important 
component and detail has to be carefully inspected. The 
survey begins with a general description of the building (the 
plot, building specifications, applicable regulations or 
bylaws, the age of building and any historical design 
features, the use of the building (domestic or commercial) 
and any other features of interest) followed by a description 
of the building materials and the standard of the fittings, the 
technical building services, the framework and structural 
characteristics. Details about ownership, tenants and 
income from rental etc. should also be included. Sketches 
should be made and measurements taken so that plans of 
the building can be drawn > 1) -@). 

The survey must also describe the building’s condition, 
with details of specific areas (facades, roof, stairs, cellar, 
and individual rooms), and all significant defective areas 
should be noted > (5). Typical problems include: cracked 
chimney tops, damaged and leaking roof structure, dry rot 
Or woodworm in the timber (eaves, roof and wall 
connections, wooden joists in floors, doors, stairs etc.), 
cracks in the masonry and plaster, structural damage, 
leaking fagades and guttering, no heat insulation and

RENOVATION OF OLD BUILDINGS 


The early half-timbered houses contained no metal (nails, 
screws etc.) and repairs are possible using only parts made 
from wood if the intention is to preserve the house in its 
Original state. The filling material used within the 
framework was traditionally earth or exposed masonry. 
There is no modern material that can be recommended as 
a substitute so these panels should be maintained and 
damaged ones repaired. Infilling with brickwork will stiffen 
the house and this is contrary to the structural principles of 
half-timbered structures. 

The main defects encountered in half-timbered buildings 
appear in verges, eaves and roof connections, gutters and 
a downpipes, connections on window plinths and other 

te timber joints, where dry rot, fungal growth, mould, insects 
Ci

RENOVATION OF OLD BUILDINGS 


The roof is the part of a building that is subjected to the 
worst effects of the weather and roof maintenance is 
therefore crucial. Small defects, which may go unnoticed, 
can result in significant damage if left for a period of time. 
For a renovation project to be successful it is vital to have 
the roof framework and cover in perfect condition. 
(Dt) 

Historically, the material used for roof construction in 
most parts of the world has been wood and all forms of roof 
truss are still based on triangular bracing in many different 
designs > 2)-@. 

To avoid later claims for damage, a thorough knowledge 
of the load distribution is required before carrying out roof 
renovation. Roof loads do not consist just of the dead 
weight of the roof and snow loading: rather, because roofs 
have a high surface area, loads are mainly imposed by 
wind. The condition and existence of wind bracing is 
therefore of great significance for the stability of the roof 
>@). 

Where there is no cellar below, it is recommended that 
existing floor coverings with no heat insulation or damp- 
proof membrane be renewed with a completely new 
structure > (©) + ().

RENOVATION OF OLD BUILDINGS 


In early times the sizing of load-bearing floor beams tn old 
buildings was calculated empirically by the carpenter. The 
loads are normally carried by cross-beams which are 
supported by one or more longitudinal joists. 

An old building manual from 1900 gives a ratio of 5:7 for 
the height and the width of a beam as a starting point for 
the determination of the required beam strength. Another 
rule of thumb held that the beam height in cm should be 
approximately half the size of the 
decimetres. Because of these methods, old wooden beam 
floors often display significant sagging. However, this does 
not endanger the structural stability as long as the 
permitted tensions are not exceeded. 

There are several options when carrying out renovation 
work: for example, joists can be strengthened by adding a 
second wooden beam and an 
distribution can be achieved with the 
additional floor beams or steel girders >()-@). In 





room depth in 


improvement in load 
installation of 





addition, the span can be shortened by installing one or 
more additional joists or a supporting cross-wall. However, 
structural changes of the framework must be preceded by 
an accurate analysis of all load-carrying and _ stiffening 
functions and the integrity of all connections must be 


checked thoroughly.

RENOVATION OF OLD BUILDINGS 


Stairs 

External and internal stairs are significant structural 
features in old buildings. If the stairs are in poor condition 
remember the most important rule for repairs is: repair only 
what can be repaired > (1) -@). 

External stairs are mostly made of natural stone and 
normally serve to reach floor levels on plinths — (2). Worn- 
down stone steps can sometimes be restored if they are 
reversed and dressed underneath. 

There are many types of design and materials used for 
internal stairs although the most common material used is 
wood. 


Wet rooms and bathrooms 

Improvement in sanitary facilities is one of the most 
important modernisation tasks. Planning of the new 
solutions should be highly sympathetic to the existing 
layout and then coordinated with the technical necessities 
+6)-©). 

Walls and floors must be planned and installed with 
care. The most serious damage to be avoided is that 
associated with leaks around showers and baths — (12 - (4. 
Faulty or missing vapour barriers mainly on outer walls 
with internal insulation can also lead to condensation 
forming in the structure. This is a major cause of rot and the 
incidence of mould.

MAINTENANCE AND RESTORATION 
Examples of solutions 


In this example, the aim was to preserve an old wooden 
structure by covering it with an arched steel roof. 

The multipurpose hall built in Munster in 1928 was 
covered over with a steel roof which was so badly damaged 
in the Second World War that it had to be completely 
renewed. However, after the war steel was too expensive to 
consider, so for 35 years the 37 x 80m hall was covered only 
by a wooden network shell with no columns. The structure 
carried just its own weight, snow load or loads such as 
lighting platforms, and had no heat insulation. 


Project requirements 
The new roof skin must: 

© meet heat insulation regulations; 

e insulate the inside from external noises and keep 

internal reflected sound to a minimum. 

The new structure should also: 

® carry special loads, such as sporting equipment, 
backdrops, lighting bridges etc.; 
be sufficiently strong to be walked on; 
be able to be mounted on the existing foundations; 
allow the network construction to be maintained; 
offer planning and manufacturing times as short as 
possible. 


Solution 

A spaceframe structure made from circular-section tubes 
screwed into nodes gave the required minimisation of the 
total weight and the existing wooden structure was 
suspended from this > (1). Twenty-two of these spaceframe 
arches are cross-linked by expanding diagonals and bridge 
an area of 37.34 x 80.30m. One of the two 70cm high rows 
of supports has sliding bearings to allow movement and the 
second row is designed as a pin-jointed support system 
—+(6). Ten transverse catwalks are installed in the 
spaceframe > (1). 

Small cranes preassembled seven large-scale structural 
elements, weighing up to 32t, which were then put in 
position in 21/2 days with a 500t crane > (7) - @). 

The structure is galvanized and painted with a PVC 
acrylic paint and a special insulation layer for corrosion and 
fire protection. The roof skin consists of purlins, steel 
trapezoidal sheets, a vapour barrier, heat insulation and 
aluminium standing seam sheeting to protect from rain 
> (4)- ©). 

The parties involved were: Munsterlandhalle GmbH, 
Hochbauamt Munster, MERO spatial structures and 
numerous specialist engineers.

MAINTENANCE AND RESTORATION 


In this example a renewal and extension was carried out by 
building a steel frame over the top of an existing building. 
On densely built-up land in Munich a light metal works had 
reached a stage at which it became necessary to renew and 
extend the forging shop. The old building had already been 
altered many times and with the installation of new 
machines had undergone many different roof 
reconstructions —> (1) - @). 

The requirements for the new shop were that it should: 

¢ have substantially greater headroom; 

¢ stand within the building lines of the old shop, 
because there was no possibility of pulling it down 
and rebuilding; 

¢ not interrupt production for more than 2-3 weeks and 
keep disruption to the minimum; 

e have an aesthetically attractive appearance that is in 
keeping with the adjacent listed administrative 
building; 

e permit the addition of a second building phase. 


Solution 
The architects selected a steel structure to take advantage of: 

° acolumn-free building > @) + @); 

¢ a large span with low dead weight 

® opportunities for prefabrication and assembly in a 

short time with lightweight equipment, a decisive 
factor in the project. 

The outer walls consist of suspended concrete- 
composite prefabricated panels. These provide the high 
noise insulation mass and robustness required for a forging 
shop as well as permitting dry assembly. 

Conversion work was precisely planned: after assembly of 
the steel structure the old shell was dismantled with a new, 
in-house overhead travelling crane and at the same time the 
new roof covering was progressively fitted > (4) - (8). 

The sloping roof with trussed rafters is hipped at one 
end of the building in order to match the hipped roof of the 
administrative building, to maintain the spacing heights 
and to permit natural ventilation. Air supply louvres are 
built into the outer walls and extract air openings are in the 


roof ridge > (Q) + 0.

MAINTENANCE AND RESTORATION 


This example examines the refurbishment of the main 
platform hall of Cologne Central Station. All corrosion and 
residual war damage was to be removed from the beautiful 
80-year-old steel structure, which has 30 main curved 
trusses. The multilayered roof skin and strip rooflights also 
had to be renewed. The historical shape had to be retained, 
despite the use of modern materials, and the building work 
could not significantly affect railway operations and traffic. 


Solution 

A travelling steel internal scaffolding unit was planned to 
give simultaneously a working platform and protect the 
railway operations below from falling tools or building 
components. It used the MERO nodal rod system, with 1400 
nodes and 5000 rods, and consisted of five main 
components that were connected together to make one 
sO0tonne element of 38m x 56m. It was moved in sections 
on six tracks and in three-weekly cycles. The individual 
parts, which were pre-assembled in a goods yard, were 
mounted on wagons and put together under the main hal! 
arch according to a time plan that had to be accurate to the 
minute > (6). 

An illustration of how new technology was used in the 
restoration work is shown in the renewal of the transverse 
wind bracing. The old system connected two curved trusses 
respectively into one rigid unit and the round steel wind 
bracing extended right down to the luggage platform. In the 
new system, four curved trusses are respectively combined 
in the lower area to make a flexurally rigid frame and the 
expansion joints reduced > @). Although the cornice details 
etc. have a lower number of profiles, they have also been 
designed to look almost identical to the old ones —> (3). 

Following completion of the restoration of the main hall 
it was planned to renew the vaulted roofs to the south east. 
Being close to the cathedral and a new museum, the 
requirements went far beyond simple functionalism and the 
awkward geometry of the tracks added further difficulty. 
Three proposals were made during an expert survey 
~+~@©@-@®. Two used intermediately suspended and 
differently curved shell construction. The third proposed a 
Spatially effective bearer system, which spans the whole 
area, like crossed vaulting —(). Because this system 
offered considerable advantages it was recommended for 
further development.

ROAD DESIGN 


To harmonise the design, construction and operational use 
of roads, standard cross-sections should be strictly 
observed unless there are special reasons. The standard 
cross-sections for open roads are shown here > (1) as are 
those for roads in built-up areas —> (2).

A positive image of space on the road can be created by 
clear but subtle dimensional changes, varying the layout of 
the individual cross-sectional parts, and a rich variety of 
vegetation on the verges. The landscaping of the road 
should promote a feeling of well-being not only on the open 
road but also inside towns. 

The verges on either side of the road have an influence 
on both the functional and visual shaping of space. The 
following items have to be co-ordinated: foot- and cycle 
paths alongside the roadway, areas for stationary vehicles, 
areas for public transport, residential areas and areas for 
manufacturing plants and commerce.

INTERSECTIONS 


Junctions are where one road flows into another (directly) 
— (1)-(@); crossroads are where two roads cross each other 
at their point of intersection > (6)—(8). Junctions on single 
Carriageways are usually in the same plane (and can be with 
or without traffic lights). 

Roundabouts —> (14)— (5) are a form of intersection popular 
in some countries (e.g. UK). They offer several advantages: 
reduced risk of serious accidents; traffic lights are rarely 
necessary; there is less noise generated and energy is 
conserved. The diameter of the roundabout depends on the 
available space and the acceptable length of the tailbacks 
caused by high volumes of oncoming traffic. An offset 
crossroads makes more room available; road intersections 
are visible at a glance and the road ends can be spacious. 
They are suitable for slow flowing traffic, as is found in 
residential districts > (6.

PATHS AND PAVING 





In addition to pavements, interlocking block paving can be 
used for pedestrianised roads, parking areas, hall floors, 
paving between rail tracks and on the beds and side slopes 
of water courses. 

The dimensions of paving blocks (length/width in cm) 
that match standard road building widths include: 
22.5/11.25; 20/10; 10/10; 12/6 etc. Kerb heights of 6, 8 and 
10cm are commonly used. 

The depth and material of the substructure (e.g. gravel, 
crushed stone with grain sizes 0.1-35 mm), which acts as a 
filter or bearing layer, should be adapted to the ground 
conditions and the expected traffic load. If the ground is load 
bearing the bearing layer should be 15-25cm deep, 
compacted until it is sufficiently stable. Pavement beds can

parking areas, fire-service access roads, spur roads, 
reinforcing slopes against erosion damage or access routes in 
areas liable to flooding, multi-sided lawn blocks are available

allowing a fast covering of stable greenery to be provided.

BICYCLE PARKING AND CYCLE PATHS 


53 ta Basic space requirements for cyclists are made up of the 

50, 50, bicycle width (0.60 m) and the height allowed for the rider 
— (§) plus the necessary room for manoeuvre under various 
conditions. Although the minimum width of a single-lane 
cycle path is 1.00m, it is preferable to increase this to 
1.40-1.60 m, particularly where riders could be travelling 
at higher speeds. Where traffic is two way, an ideal width 
of 1.60-2.00m allows oncoming cyclists to pass each other 
safely as well as making it easy to overtake slower riders.

TRAMWAY S/URBAN LIGHT RAILWAYS 


A tramway is controlled entirely by sight and shares the 
road with other general traffic; an urban light railway travels 
Over stretches of track with standard train safety 
equipment, just like the underground (US: subway) or main 
line railways, as well as alongside roads on special track 
bed. (The underground travels only on_ defined, 
independent track beds, with no crossings, and does not 
mix with urban traffic.) 
°e Track gauge. the standard gauge is 1.435m, or a 
metric gauge of 1.000m, and the clearance width is 
the carriage frame width (2.30-2.65m) plus extra to 
compensate for deflectional movement on curves 
and an extra allowance for the width on cambers plus 
sway (at least 2 X 0.15m) 
¢ Distance of kerbstone from carriage frame _ for 
special track beds 0.50m; can be as little as 0.30m in 
exceptional cases 
¢ Carriage heights the height of the carriage body 
should be <3.40m; min. height allowance for safe 
passage under buildings is 4.20m, and on roads 
should be 5.00m 
e Safety clearance space 0.85m width from the 
outside limit of the vehicle outline on the door side of 
rail vehicles. 
The width of street platforms should be at least 3.50m 
(although 2m can be regarded as an absolute minimum for 
platforms on the side of streets where space is limited). 
Where a waiting room is to be incorporated, the platform 
width should be at least 5.50m. The platform length should 
exceed the train length by >5m to allow for inaccurate 
braking.

TRAFFIC LAYOUT 


Urban railways with overhead conductor cables — or, even 
better, with conductor rails — work efficiently on their own 
tracks and can be separated by railings or hedges from the 
road traffic > ()+(). Elevated railways () allow traffic to 
move freely below and improve rail traffic circulation 
because trains are not affected by road signals; however 
they increase noise for residents. A better solution is to run 
railways in shallow or deep cuttings, or even underground 
+@O+6+@. 

Road noise in flat terrain is reduced by uninhabited 
buildings (e.g. garages), which provide sound insulation, by 
planting trees or by using backfilled earth embankments 
planted with trees. Even more effective are roads partly in 
cuttings with planted earth slopes or sunk completely in a 
cutting > (@)- 0. 

In general, it is only possible to put in noise suppressing 
walls with new roads, particularly when planning the layout 
of new areas where high-speed traffic (100-120km/h) can be 
segregated from residential buildings and run in cuttings 
with slip roads leading to the residential areas. These would 
be flanked by rows of garages, with parking places in front 
of them, and linked by wide footpaths leading to the 
houses/flats. Plenty of lawns and evergreen trees (i.e. 
conifers), improve the quiet, homely environment. 

Elevated roads are only convenient for commercial and 
industrial estates, where the road noise causes less 
disturbance.

TRAFFIC NOISE 
Guidelines for Road Noise Shielding 


Increased environmental concerns have made reduction of 
traffic noise a top priority. Effective measures include earth 
mounds and noise shielding walls and pyramids > (1)-(@. 
There are many suitable pre-cast concrete products on the 
market today as well as sound insulating walls made from 
glass, wood and steel. 

The sound level of road traffic can be reduced by =25 
dB(A) after passing through a noise shielding wall. (With a 
reduction of 10 dB(A), the sound seems half as loud.) 

The shielding effect is dependent on the wall material 
but far more so on its height. This is because refraction 
bends the path of the sound waves so a small part of the 
sound energy arrives in the shadow area. The higher the 
wall the lower the amount of sound penetration, and the 
longer the detour for the refracted sound.

SECURING EMBANKMENTS 


Long rounded banks with their faces planted as lawns or 
with shrubs and trees are aesthetically desirable but all 
steeply sloping surfaces must be secured. For a bank which 
is steeper than the natural angle of repose, turf, wattle, 
cobbles or retaining walls can be used for this purpose. 

If the slope is more than 1:2 use grass turf fixed with 
wooden pegs or stepped turf for securing steeper slopes of 
1:1.5 to 1:0.5 > p. 230. Wattle is suitable for fixing steep 
slopes on which it is difficult to establish plant growth — p. 
230. It is necessary to distinguish between dead and live 
wattle: in the case of live wattle (willow cuttings) 
subsequent permanent planting with deciduous shrubs is 
called for because willow is only a pioneer plant. 

Vegetation is not suitable for securing large bank 
cuttings, such as in road building or on sloping plots, so 
more expensive artificial forms of retention are necessary —> 
M6) 

There are several types of anchored frameworks that can 
be used to create retaining walls. The simplest consists of 
horizontal, preanchored beams and vertical posts, with 
intermediate areas covered with reinforced sprayed 
concrete -» 4). With planted supporting walls considerable 
height differences can be overcome to create ample space 
for roads or building plots in uneven terrain > ©) + (7). High 
walls can also be built with earth anchors, depending upon 
the system and the slope -> 45).

GARDEN ENCLOSURES 


In most countries, neighbours have legal rights tn relation 
to fencing. Within an area built as an integrated 
development, the owner of a building used for domestic or 
business purposes is obliged at the request of the owner 
of the neighbouring plot to enclose his plot along the 
common boundary. Local (or national) regulations may, if 
both plots are built on or used commercially, require both 
owners to erect a boundary fence/wall jointly and share 
the cost. Under English law, ownership of, and 
responsibility for, fences etc. is spelt out in the property 
owner's deeds. 

A ‘common fence’ is located in the centre of the 
boundary whereas with an ‘own fence’ the foundation wall 
should be flush with the boundary. 

The style of fence chosen should always suit the locality 
as far as possible — ©) - @0. Fencing that is intended to 
protect against wild animals should be sunk 10-20cm into 
the ground, particularly between hedges ~ @?. 

Wooden fencing, posts, frames and palisades can last 
more than 30 years if they are first chemically impregnated 
in a tank. 

Wooden louvre fences are best for privacy —> (7) + (8) and 
can also provide some measure of sound insulation. 
Scissor or rustic fencing is also popular for plot enclosure

GARDEN ENCLOSURES 


The owner of a plot usually erects fencing only on one 
long side since the neighbour on the other side puts up the 
fence on that long boundary. 

Wire mesh fencing — @) can be obtained in many mesh 
sizes to cover a wide range of usage conditions and if the 
mesh is plastic coated and supported by galvanised posts 
the fence will require close to no maintenance. Mesh fences 
can be braced with wooden, concrete or steel posts which 
are anchored in the ground > (7) + 49. Ornamental wire or 
lattice fencing is usually spot-welded and galvanised » (3) + 
@). 
Wrought-iron fencing can be elaborate or simple in 
design and almost any shape is possible — ©. 

Natural stone such as granite or quartz quarry stone can 
be used without any processing + @) or cut to shape by a 
stonemason - @). If possible, only one sort of stone should 
be used.

PERGOLAS, PATHS, STEPS, 
RETAINING WALLS 


Prefabricated paving slabs are ideal for creating solid and 
easily maintained garden paths between beds —> @). Paving 
stones can be laid in the borders or the lawn, either raised 
or flush with the surface > 6) - %. Allow for a gradient when 
laying paths — 40 - 42. (See also page 217.) 

Examples (3) - @4 show various arrangements for garden 
steps. They should be safe and easy to use (note that a 
concave gradient is more comfortable to walk on — (&) + @) 
but should also fit harmoniously into the surroundings. The 
steps should slope gently forwards to permit rainwater to 
run off. In gardens that are designed to be as close as 
possible to a natural state, log steps are a worthy solution 
+ (3) + 9. Whatever type of garden steps are chosen, the 
same rules as apply to indoor stairs should be taken into 
account > pp. 191-4. 

It is possible to incorporate ramps in the garden steps to 
facilitate movement of bicycles, prams and roller waste bins 
+ @5. Wheelchairs being pushed by carers can also make 
use of such ramps. 

Layered dry stone construction can be used for retaining 
walls up to 2m high in front of uncultivated earth, with an 
inclination to the slope of 5-20% — @6. However, concrete 
retaining walls — @7 are simpler and cheaper, and can be 
bought as ready-made sections > @8 in various sizes and 
shapes such as corner profiles, quarter segment profiles 
and round sections, making it possible to form bends with 
standard parts.

EARTHWORKS 


Topsoil can be stored on site by temporarily removing it and 
building soil mounds — @. If it is not in the shade, the top 
of the mound should be protected (with turf, straw etc.) to 
prevent excessive drying out. Topsoil mounds should be 
turned over at least once per year, and 0.5kg of quicklime 
added per cubic metre. If the topsoil needs to be stored for 
very lengthy periods, consider sowing plants on the 
mound. 

When making up the ground again after the earthworks 
are completed, compaction measures are necessary if 
landscaping, lawn laying or planting work is to be carried 
out immediately, and especially if the work involves laying 
paths and paved areas. The following techniques can be 
considered. 

e Rolling using a tracked vehicle (e.g. bulldozer) usually 

provides sufficient compaction for each layer of fill. 

© Soaking can be used, but only if the filling material is 

good (sand and gravel). 

¢ Rolling with a drum roller to compact stable soil in 

layers (fill height 30-40cm per layer) is another 
option. Note that it is important always to roll from 
Outside towards the centre (i.e. from the slope 
towards the centre of the built-up surface). Use 
rolling for broken stone hardcore when building 
roads and paths. 
Tamping or ramming is possible on all stable soils. 
Vibration can be used in the case of loose, non- 
binding materials. 
All compaction should take account of subsequent work. 
For paths and paved areas compaction is needed up to and 
including the top layer while lawns require 10cm of loose 
topsoil, and planted areas 40cm. 


Slope protection 

To avoid slippage and erosion by wind, water run-off etc. 
the filling on slopes should be laid in layers. Serrated 
subsoil profiles + @) prevent the loose infill mass from 
forming a slip plane on the base material. In the case of 
higher banks with steeper slopes > (3), stepping provides an 
effective means of preventing slippage (step width >50cm). 
If steps are inclined into the slope a longitudinal gradient 
must be created to allow any build up of water to run away.

Banked beds are ideal for 
growing vegetables in the 
garden. They offer’ the 
possibility of quick harvests 
and very high yields. The 
most important factors in 
constructing a banked bed 
are the correct build-up and a 
north-south orientation —> 
1) - @). Although they require 
some effort to build, banked 
beds can be used for several 
years. In general, a banked 
bed is approximately 1.50m 
wide and 4m long and 
watered with a sprinkler hose 
+ @) or trickle irrigation. It is 
best to carry out’ the 
construction process in the 
autumn when the most 
garden debris is available. 
Mixed planting has proved to 
be particularly effective in 
banked and raised beds. 

The raised bed is a 
variation of the banked bed in 
that it has the same 
composition and is, in 
principle, a compost heap 
contained by a boarded frame 
+ ©). Any rot-resistant 
material is suitable and can 
be used instead of wooden 
boards (e.g. impregnated 
logs, wood blocks, or stone 
walls). In addition to the 
advantages of the_- rich 
bedding material, the plants 
also benefit from the sunshine 
which impinges on the side 
walls. 

If the beds are 
600-800 mm high, it is no 
longer necessary to bend 
when planting seeds, bedding 
plants or harvesting > @) + 
(8), which makes raised beds 
ideal for the elderly and 
wheelchair users. Raised 
beds give increased yields 
when they are filled with 
layers of organic materials, 
tree stumps at the bottom, 
then branches, then chopped 
twigs up to well rotted 
compost.

GREENHOUSES 


The ventilation of green- 
houses should be calculated 


such that, when _ fully 
ventilated, the inside 
temperature can be _ held 


close to that outside. For this 
it is necessary that about 20% 
of the roof area consists of a 
ventilation strip or windows 
that can be opened individ- 
ually. An adequate supply of 
fresh air must also. be 
ensured. 

Where there is insufficient 
natural shading from outside 
it may be necessary to install 
sun blinds in order to 
maintain temperate conditions 
during bright sunshine. 
Blinds can be installed on the 
inside or outside of the 
greenhouse. Although those 
inside are more economical, 
exterior blinds are more 
effective, particularly when 
there is a_ sufficient gap 


between the blinds and the 


glass > QO + 40.

GARDENS: TREES AND HEDGES 


Fertile soil contains an abundance of life, with the different 
layers being inhabited by different groups of species = (1). 
Tree roots can penetrate the soil down to rocky layers and 
the shape of the underground root network is usually a 
mirror image of the shape of the tree’s crown > ©). 

For cultivated trees the cup shape is preferred. These 
have open centres from which the branches are drawn 
outwards so that light can penetrate the treetops. Side 
branches are kept short so they will not break under the 
weight of fruit or snow. 

The best time for planting fruit trees is late autumn 
(October in areas with early frost, November and in milder 
areas). Grafting points, which can be clearly recognised as 
a swelling on the end of the stem, must always be above 
the soil surface. Supporting posts must be a handbreadth 
away from the trunk and should be to the south to prevent 
sunburn. > @) 

When planting hedges the correct distance from the 
neighbouring plot must be maintained: 0.25m for hedges 
up to 1.2m high, 0.5m for hedges up to 2m high and 0.75m 
for hedges over 2m. Hedges are ideal for providing privacy 
in one’s own garden as well as protection from noise and 
dust. They also reduce wind speed, increase dew formation, 
regulate heat and prevent soil erosion. Banked hedges (so- 
called ‘quick-set hedges’ — @0) are used as windbreaks in 
coastal areas.

GARDEN PONDS 


Careful consideration needs to be given as to how best to 
integrate a pond into the garden. To begin with, selecting 
the correct position is extremely important for the well- 
being of the plants and animals in and around the pond. For 
instance, the majority of bog and water plants require 
plenty of sunlight (about 4-6 hours per day). The pond also 
needs to be easy to view so the best position is in the 
proximity of a terrace or a seating area, where it can be 
observed at leisure. 

In addition, the constituent elements of the pond need to 
be carefully planned. If the correct proportions of plants, 
water and sand are used, a biological balance can be 
achieved within 6-8 weeks, at which time the water 
becomes clear. One of the most important factors in this is 
to have the correct ratio of water surface to water volume (a 
pond average of around 400! per m2 of water surface is 
recommended). The garden pond will then become a 
habitat for both insects and plants. 

The planting of the pond is done before the water is 
carefully topped up to its final level. The pond edge and 
surrounds need to be specially designed: bog and flood 
water zones, as well as moist beds, > @) + @) help to expand 
the pond area and create a more natural balance. The pond 
should be sized according to the area of the garden: a water 
area of 20-25m2 is ideal, although even 3-5m? gives 
enough room for many types of plants. Generous shallow 
water zones of 50-200mm depth and a deep area of at least 
600mm in depth are necessary for the survival of aquatic 
insects and larvae during the winter months. The deep 
areas also provide a place of hiding for all of the pond 
inhabitants. 

The pond should be kept full throughout the winter to 
reduce the possibility of it being forced out of the ground or 
tilted by the action of ground frost. 

Fish, frogs and other amphibians will only survive the 
winter if the pond is protected from freezing over 
completely for extended periods so an ice preventer or a 
heating stone should be used. 

Prefabricated ponds provide planting shelves at 
appropriate depths and these prevent gravel and planting 
soil from slumping or sliding away completely > @).

(2) Drinking water supplementary supply 


In the design of new buildings it 
is desirable to include means 
for collecting and_ storing 
rainwater. Rainwater systems 
can also be installed in existing 
houses or gardens. The storage 
volume should be generous 
because the greater the volume, 
the more the potential econ- 
omies. The average storage 
required for garden watering 
(given 40-60l/m2 as a typical 
annual usage) for a_ single 
family house is about 50001 (it 
depends on the area of garden, 
annual rainfall, roof area and 
run-off value). To calculate 
domestic water needs, use the 
following figures for average 
water consumption per person 
per day: 15I drinking/cooking, 
10! washing, 401 bathing/ 
showering (total: 65! potable 
water); 181 clothes washing, 41 
cleaning, 451 WC flushing (181 
with economy flush), 8] 
sundries (total: 75! rainwater or 
481 with economy flushing). 


Example 

Annual rainfall 800mm = 8001/m2 
Pitched roof run-off value f = 0.75 
Net roof area = 120m2 

Rainwater production = net roof area 
(m2) x annual rainfall (I/m?) x run-off 
value (f) 

= 800 x 120 x 0.75 

= 72000 I/year 


Number of persons = 4 

Usage per day = 451 per person 

(WC with economy flush) 

Garden area = 200m? 

Annual garden watering = 50I/m2 
Rainwater requirement = persons 
usage per day (I) x 365 days) + (garden 
area (m2) x usage per year (I/m?)) 

(4 x 45 x 365) + (200 x 50) 

= 75700 |/year 


Factor g = (1 - [rainwater production 
+ rainwater requirement]) x 100% 

= (1 - [72000/75700]) x 100 = 4.9% 
(this is less than 20% so use g = 0.05) 
Storage requirement = rainwater 
production (Il) x g 

= 72(t]000 x 0.05 

= 3600! 

Recommendation: 45001 rainwater 
storage tank 


Explanations 

Net area: the plan area of the 
roof connected to the gutters 
(equivalent to the plan area of 
the house). 

Annual rainfall: mean annual 
rainfall (e.g. typical values are 
740-900 mm = 740-9001/m?) as 
read from appropriate rainfall 
maps or information from a 
local weather station. 

Run-off value (f): f = 0.75 for 
pitched and flat roofs. 

Factor g: when the difference 
between rainwater production 
and rainwater requirement is 
less than 20%, use g = 0.05. 

g = 0.03 when the difference 
between rainwater production 
and rainwater requirement is 
more than 20%. 

g = 0.20-0.40 when the water 
is used mainly for garden 
watering and when there are 
large seasonal rainfall variations.

SWIMMING POOLS 


The ideal position for a garden 
pool is sheltered from the wind 
and visible from the kitchen and 
living room (to allow supervision 
of children). There should be no 
deciduous trees or shrubs 
immediately next to the pool and 
a surrounding walkway ought to 
be provided to prevent grass etc. 
from falling into the water. 

Realistically, the pool should 
no less than 2.25m wide and the 
length worked out on the basis of 
a swimming stroke length of 
approximately 1.50m plus body 
length (e.g. four swimming 
strokes equates to 8m). The 
standard water depth is usually 
based on the average height to 
the chin of an adult. The 
difference between the overall 
pool depth and the water depth 
depends on the type of water 
extraction system —> (9) - (7). 

For reasons of cost and the 
water circulation system (see 
below), the shape of the pool 
should be kept as simple as 
possible. 

The standard type of pool 
design uses a sealed surface on 
a supporting structure made of 
masonry — (8), concrete, steel 
(particularly for above ground 
pools) or dug out of the earth 
— (5). Polyester pools (which are 
rarely made on site, being 
mostly made up from prefab- 
ricated parts) are generally not 
self-supporting so lean concrete 
backfill necessary > (6). Cast or 
sprayed concrete pools -» (7) 
must be watertight. The surface 
is usually ceramic tiles or glass 
mosaic, although they are 
sometimes painted (chlorine 
rubber, cement paints). 

The water needs to be kept 
clean and this is normally done 
by water circulation systems and 
filters. The process is improved 
with a good surface cleaning 
system using a skimmer — (8) or 
channel —> (0) +41. Adding a 
regulated countercurrent plant or 
through-flow heater can extend 
the swimming season consider- 
ably without prohibitive costs. 

Other factors to consider are 
child-proofing measures and 
frost protection.

PRIVATE SWIMMING POOLS 


Atmosphere is a very important factor in the enjoyment of 
indoor pools so they should be well lit with natural daylight. 
An ideal location for the pool is at the rear of the house, 
overlooking the garden. With removable or sliding wall and 
ceiling panels it is possible to give the feel of being in an 
outdoor pool when the weather permits. Although this is

The main problem with indoor pools is controlling the air 
humidity. Water evaporates from the pool at rates from 
2 2

NL in use) and the process continues until the saturation point

layer’ develops just above the pool surface. Therefore, the 
water should not be disturbed by strong air currents from 
(1) Arrangements relating to indoor pools the ventilation system. 

Removing moisture from the pool area is very expensive 
using ventilation systems but it is indispensable. If the air 
humidity is above 70% every small heat bridge can lead to 
structural damage within a short time. Ventilation 
equipment may be fresh air or a mixed air system = p. 243, 
with ducts in the ceiling and floor, or ventilation box and 
extractor (with the air flow kept low to avoid draughts). 

The most common structural design is a fully insulated 
all-weather pool with glazed panel roof and walls. Less 
common are non-insulated ‘summer’ pools (which can also 
be of a kind that can be dismantled). The materials used 
should be corrosion-proof (galvanised steel, aluminium,

Pools that are within the 
fabric of residential proper- 
ties or hotel buildings are 
generally constructed from 
reinforced concrete and 
supported separately. It is 
essential that they have 
groundwater compensating 
valves to avoid damage to the 
pool although expansion 
joints are unnecessary for 
pools under 12m long. Plastic 
pools are used only in 
exceptional cases because of 
the requirement for a 
Surrounding inspection and 
services passage — (7). Their 
use is only possible with a 
special reinforcing support 
structure. 

Pool linings can be 
ceramic tiles, glass mosaic or 
a simple painted layer (so 
long as waterproof cement 
has been used). Another 
possibility is to use a 
polyester or PVC film at least 
1.5mm thick to seal the pool. 

The edge of the pool 
requires at least a surface 
skimmer arrangement or, 
better still, an overflow 
channel to feed the filtration 
and recirculation system. 
There are several types that 
can be considered —> (1) - ©. 

Plan for a drainage grille at 
the deepest point and, 
possibly, a counter-current 
swimming system and under- 
water floodlights. All such 
fittings must be installed with 
sealed flanges. 


The surrounding — floor 
finish is normally © slip- 
resistant ceramic tiles or 


natural stone and must be 
inclined towards the pool or 
overflow channel on all sides. 
It is also possible to use 
water-permeable carpet floor- 
ing on a damp-proof base. 
This improves both comfort 
and the hall acoustics. 

For indoor hotel pools, it is 
important to have large 
surrounding lounge areas 
with chairs and lockers. A 
separate connection between 
hotel rooms and the pool area 
is essential.

PANTRIES, LARDERS 


When planning houses or flats, space should be allocated 
for rooms such as larders, pantries or cold stores. The most 
practical solution is to have a larder in or beside the kitchen 
+ Q) - @). It must be cool, well-ventilated and shaded from 
the sun. Connections for a freezer unit and a drinks cooler 
should also be provided if the larder is of sufficient size and 
storage shelves are best arranged right up to the ceiling.

store. These are supplied in modular form in a range of

width of 75cm and good ventilation) in the house. For larger 
dwellings at least 2% of the living area should be planned 
as storage room. The space is needed for storing cleaning 
equipment and materials, tools, ironing board, shopping 
baskets and bags, cases, stepladder etc. Doors should open

KITCHENS 
Built-in and Fitted Units 


Despite increasing standardisation, the dimensions and 
manufacturing ranges of kitchen fittings still vary 
considerably. Built-in units are generally available from 
20-120cm (in 5cm steps), usually with a height of 85cm. 

In an architect-designed kitchen, the various elements 
are assembled in a way that cannot be altered, with 
worktops and storage surfaces, possibly including an 
electric oven (with cut-outs for hotplates) and a continuous 
cover plate. 

The materials used in kitchen units include, wood, 
plywood, chipboard and plastic. Exposed wood surfaces are 
varnished or laminated with plastic. Shelves are of wood or 
plastic-coated chipboard; metal shelves are best for pots 
and pans. Sliding or folding doors are useful if space is 
restricted because they require no additional space when 
opened. 

Floor units ~ @ + @ are for storing large, heavy or 
seldom-used kitchen equipment. Wall-mounted cabinets — 
(3) + @ have a small depth so that the worktops beneath 
them can be used without hindrance. They allow crockery 
to be reached without bending. 

Full-height cupboards — (@) can be used for storing 
cleaning materials, brooms etc. but are are also suitable for 
housing refrigerators, ovens, or microwaves at a 
convenient height. 

Sinks and draining boards should be fitted into floor 
units, which may also include a waste bin, dishwasher and 
disposal units (and, if necessary, an electric water heater). 

Special equipment, such as retractable breadbins with 
universal cutting board, equipment cupboards with special 
pull-out or hinged compartments, retractable kitchen 
scales, spice drawers, pull-out towel rails etc., save time 
and effort. 

An extractor above the cooker is recommended => 42 and 
extractor hoods are most suitable for this task. There is a 
differentiation to be made between air extraction and 
recirculation systems. Extractor systems require a vent to 
the outside but are more effective than recirculation 
systems and so are the preferred type.

KITCHENS 


The dimensions of built-in 
units and equipment must be 
taken into consideration 
when designing the layout 
and storage areas of a space- 
efficient kitchen. Modern 
electrical and gas units as 
well as kitchen furniture are 
made such that they can 
usually be fitted together and 
built in, giving combinations 
that ensure a smooth flow of 
work. Provide _ sufficient 
shock-proof sockets: a 
minimum of one _ double 
socket for each working and 
preparation area. 

A double sink unit is 
usually required > (7%) - @Q), 
ideally with a draining surface 
On one side and a standing 
surface on_- the — other. 


Dishwashers should be fitted 
to the right or left of the sink. 
Where the kitchen is very 
small, compact kitchens — 
offer a solution. They require 
little space and can be fitted 
with many useful features.

BEDROOMS 


To ensure comfort while 
sleeping, the bed length 
should be 250mm _ longer 
than the individual’s height. 
Based on average heigNhts, 
beds are produced in a 
range of standard sizes: 900 
<x 1900 mm, 1000 x 1900 mm, 
1000 x 2000 mm, 1600 x 
2000 mm and 2000 x 
2000 mm. The bedroom 
layout should give at least 
600mm, preferably 750mm, 
around the bed — (1). This is 
important to allow the bed 
to be made easily and also, 
if there is a cupboard 
standing parallel to the bed, 
to give enough space for 
movement even if the 
cupboard doors are open. 

There should always be 
a bedside cabinet to the left 
and right of double beds 
and a headboard, onto 
which one can fix clip lights 
for reading, is also useful > 
(2). Bedside lamps should 
be provided in addition to 
general lighting. 

About 1m of cupboard 
length should be planned 
per person. If there is not 
enough room in the bed- 
room, then space can be 
found in the corridor > @0. 
At least one mirror, in which 
One can see oneself from 
head to toe, should be fitted 
in a bedroom: mirrored 
cupboard fronts are even 
better.

BEDROOMS 


Bed Positions 


The position of the bed within a room can have a significant effect on a person's feelings of well-being: 





(1) Against side wall (2) With head to wall G3) Away from the wall (4) In centre of room 


A self-assured person is happy to sleep anywhere in the room whereas somebody with an anxious disposition may prefer 
to sleep next to a wall: 





S 
<3 


eS (\ 
< y 
(6) In corner of room (7) In wall alcove + In cupboard alcove 


In addition to room decoration and furnishings, a restful atmosphere also depends on the orientation of the bed (head best 
towards north), position with respect to the light (looking away from window) and the door (looking towards door). Where 
there is more than one bed their position with respect to each other is important: 








(12) Guests 


Different arrangements of beds may be desirable if friends, sisters, brothers or guests sleep in one room: 






some people 
prefer to lie in 
opposite directions 


(3) Double bed, single mattress Double bed, two mattresses (15) Two beds, side by side Bunk arrangement 





The arrangement of double beds (and single beds placed side by side or as bunks) has more to do with personal preference 
than space. Separate beds have now become common for couples whereas an enclosed double bed was customary in the past: 





a7) Box bed Four-poster bed Canopy bed Ornate bed surround 


The last example is formed like a basilica and lit by a special ceiling light when the curtains are closed. These last four 
examples show how the room and furniture decoration has depended strongly on the customs of the era.

BEDROOMS 


Bed Alcoves and Wardrobes 


2.00 1.25 3.25 Built-in cupboards and fitted wardrobes are ideal for owner- 
occupied houses, whereas free-standing units are better for 
rented housing. With small rooms it is necessary to make 
use of every space and this need can be satisfied effectively 
by creative use of built-in cupboards. Highly suitable are 
complete fitted wardrobes or cupboard rooms in walls 
between the bedrooms.

Cubicles 


Traditional wet room installations usually involve 
substantial expenditure and a lot of time. Because the 
requirements are largely standardised, prefabrication is 
desirable, especially for terraced and multi-family housing 
projects, holiday homes, apartments, hotel facilities and for 
old building restoration work. Sanitary blocks can be 
prefabricated — @) - @), as well as utility walls or complete 
cubicles > @)- (3, with premounted piping as well as units 
with accessories. Prefabricated compact cubicles are 
supplied in a range of fixed dimensions. 

Prefabricated cubicles are mostly sandwich construction, 
with wooden frame and chipboard or fibre-cement panels. 
They use aluminium, moulded stainless steel or glass-fibre 
reinforced plastic to match the units and accessories.

BATHROOMS 


Location 


Bathrooms with WCs are self-contained rooms which are 
equipped with all of the fittings necessary to meet all the 
sanitary needs of the occupants. However, the plan should 
ideally include two separate lockable rooms for the 
bathroom and WC and this is essential in dwellings for 
more than five people. A bathroom with WC can be directly 
accessible from the bedroom as long as another WC can be 
reached from the corridor —> @) + 40. 

A bathtub and/or shower tray plus a wash-basin are 
installed in the bathroom, while a flushing toilet, bidet and 
hand washing basin are installed in the WC. 

For cost efficiency and technical reasons the bathroom, 
WC and kitchen should be planned such that they can share 
the same service ducts > @) + @, @ —- 40. In multistorey 
homes, an arrangement such that the utility walls for the 
bathrooms and WCs are directly above one another helps to 
keep installation costs and the necessary sound insulation 
measures as low as possible. However, adjacent bathrooms 
in two different flats must not be connected to a single 
supply or discharge pipe system. 

The bathroom and WC should be orientated towards 
the north, and should normally be naturally lit and 
ventilated. At least four air changes per hour are required 
for internal rooms. For comfort, a bathroom temperature 
of 22 to 24°C is about right. A temperature of 20°C is 
suitable for WCs in homes. This is higher than that 
encountered in office buildings, where 15 to 17°C is the 
common norm. 

Bathrooms are particularly susceptible to damp so 
appropriate sealing must be provided. Surfaces must be 
easy to clean because of high air humidity and 
condensation, and the wall and ceiling plaster must be able 
to withstand the conditions. Choose slip resistant floor 
coverings. 

Consider the required noise insulation: the noise levels 
from domestic systems and appliances heard in 
neighbouring flats or adjoining rooms must not exceed 35 
dB(A). 

At least one sealed electrical socket should be provided 
at a height of 1.30m beside the mirror for electrical 
equipment. It is also necessary to consider the following for 
the bathroom/WC: cupboards for towels, cleaning items, 
medicines and toiletries (possibly lockable), mirror and 
lighting, hot water supply, supplementary heater, towel 
rails, drier, handles above the bathtub, toilet paper holder 
within easy reach, toothbrush holder, soap container and 
storage surfaces.

CARPORTS 


Covered parking spaces (preferably with a solid wall on the 
weather side) provide an economical and space-saving way 
of providing adequate weather protection for vehicles. 

A combination of carport and lockable store (for bicycles 
etc.) is recommended — ©). 

Carports are delivered as complete building kits, 
including post anchors, ironmongery and screws, as well as 
gutters and downpipes -> (3) - (4).

Factors to take into account when assessing a plot are: 
prevailing wind direction, groundwater, drinking water 
supply, drainage, heating, access and parking space for 
cars. Whenever possible, construction should be from 
natural local materials (stone or wood). For security 
reasons, furnishings should be secured and entrances fitted 
with lockable shutters to protect against theft.

Favourable (preferred) and 
unfavourable positions on 
slopes and streets 


Optimal residential sites 

As a rule, sites to the west and south of towns and cities are 
preferred for residential development in areas where the 
prevailing winds are generally southerlies or westerlies 
(e.g. many parts of western Europe). This means the houses 
receive fresh air from the countryside while urban pollution 
is dissipated to the north and east. These latter areas, 
therefore, are not desirable for housing and should instead 
be considered for industrial buildings. Note that in 
mountainous areas or by lakes the wind behaviour 
described above may be different. For example, sunny 
southern and eastern slopes in the north and west of a city 
located in a valley basin could be sought-after locations for 
the construction of private homes. 


Plots located on mountain slopes 

Plots located on the lower side of mountain roads are 
particularly favourable because they offer the possibility of 
driving directly up to the house, where a garage can be 
located, and leave a tranquil rear garden with an 
uninterrupted view and sun. On the upper side of the street, 
this is far harder to provide and walls and concrete ditches 
are usually necessary behind the house to guard against 
falling rocks and collect rainwater running off the mountain. 


Plots located by water 

The potential nuisance from mosquitoes and foggy 
conditions make it inadvisable to build too close to rivers 
and lakes. 


Orientation relative to the street 

For separate houses with boundary walls, the most 
favourable plots are usually situated south of the street so 
that all auxiliary rooms, together with the entrance, are then 
automatically positioned facing the street. This solves any 
privacy problems because it leaves the main living and 
sleeping areas located on the quiet, sunny side (east--south- 
-west), facing away from the street and overlooking the 
garden. If the plot has sufficient width, large French 
windows, terraces and balconies can be used to good 
effect. = @ 


conservatory

very good 


(5) Preferred house orientation 
on streets with various 
directions 


Plots are generally narrow and deep in order to keep the 
street side as short as possible. If the plot is situated to the 
north of the street, the building should be located towards 
the rear, despite the extra costs of a longer access. This is in 
order to take advantage of the sunny front garden area. 
Buildings on such plots can be impressive when seen from 
the street. = @) 

Plots on the east of streets running north-south ~ (@) are 
the most favourable in areas with westerly prevailing winds 
because gardens and living areas then face east, which is 
the most sheltered. Additionally, it is less likely that there 
will be neighbouring buildings close enough to obstruct 
low sun in the east. To take advantage of winter sun (low in 
the southern sky), the buildings must be situated close to 
the northern boundary so a large area of terrace can be 
south-facing. Plots on the west of a north-south street 
should be planned in a way that maximises the amount of 
southern sunlight received and gives an unobstructed view 
from the terrace. This might require the house to be built on 
the rear boundary —> @). The most favourable plots for 
houses in streets running in other directions are shown in 
+ 6). 

Plots adjacent to existing houses built on the sunny side 
have the advantage that the position and ground-plan of the 
new house can be designed in a way that ensures the sun 
will not be obstructed at any time in the future. 


Room orientation 

Whenever possible, all living and sleeping areas should 
face towards the garden on the sunny side of the house, 
with the utility areas on the opposite side > @). This allows 
rooms that are occupied for the most time to take 
advantage of natural solar heating. Use of a local sun 
diagram (pp. 164 and 165) will indicate when the sun will 
shine into a room, or a part thereof, at a particular hour for 
any season. This information may also be used to decide 
which way the building should be orientated and where it 
should be placed to avoid being shaded by neighbouring 
buildings, trees and the like.

By using courtyards it is 
possible to provide addit- 
ional living space that is 
both sheltered and private. 
In contrast to detached 
housing, courtyard devel- 
opments allow a_ high 
quality of life to be offered 
to occupants using only a 
comparatively small 
amount of land area. 

Enclosed courtyards can 
be as small as a living room 
but might need to be 
artificially lit if the 
surrounding walls are all 
higher than one storey. If, 
however, a garden court- 
yard is required much 
larger areas are desirable to 
take full advantage of the 
sunlight and allow a full 
range of plants to be 
considered.

HOUSES WITH CONSERVATORIES 


Conservatories are not 
simple glass buildings, but 
complex systems that must 
be designed with technical 
precision. Depending on the 
different uses of the 
conservatory, the glass 













a / kitchen X — system, the ventilation and 
“kitchen %~ \ shading must be harmon- 
Saree 4@ entrance Wy ised in order to make it 


work satisfactorily. 

A conservatory provides 
a buffer zone between the 
outside climate and the 
interior of the house. Glass 
structures work as solar 
energy collectors and in 
favourable climatic circum- 
stances the potential energy 
savings for the whole house 
can be about 25%. A 
westward orientation of the 
conservatory can substan- 
tially raise the environ- 
mental quality of the 
habitat. 

It is recommended that 
glass doors are incorporated 
in the transition area 
between the house and the 
conservatory in order to 
separate both spaces from a 
heating point of view and for 
reasons of comfort within 
the house and energy 
efficiency.

ECOLOGICAL BUILDING 


The timber house is the 
epitome of natural, tradit- 
ional and healthy living. This 
form of construction 
conforms to many clients’ 
ecological, biological and, 
not least, economical, 
requirements. It uses 
selected solid timbers, 
natural insulation materials 
(e.g. cotton, wool or cork), 
natural materials for the 
roofing (e.g. clay tiles), and 
plant-based paints for 
decoration, all leading to a 
high standard of eco- 
friendliness. 

Usually, only the slow 
growing timbers’ from 
northern countries are used 
for this type of construction. 
Unlimited life and low 
maintenance are the rule: for 
example, red cedar, as it is 
commonly known, contains 
a tannin which acts as a 
natural wood preservative, 
making impregnation un- 
necessary. Deeply _ over- 
hanging roofs are used to 
shelter the facades. 
Manufacturers offer several 
types of external wall 
construction. Double-block 
construction consists usually 
of two. identical leafs 
containing an_ insulation 
layer between. Single-leaf 
log walls produce the typical 
traditional atmosphere of 
the log cabin. The purchaser 
Honka Haus has the choice of round logs 
or squared blocks. 

Many timber houses can 
be freely planned to meet 
the client’s requirements. 
The client also has a choice 
of which type of timber to 
use (spruce, larch, cedar). 
Many suppliers offer self- 
build options together with 
assistance from the firm's 
construction specialists.

MULTISTOREY HOUSING 


(1) Blocks 

A compact, layered building form (either single buildings or 
in groups) that gives high occupancy densities. The external 
spaces within and around the building are clearly 
differentiated in relation to form and function. 














(2) Linear arrangement 

A spacious building configuration: either groups of identical 
block types or of buildings of completely different designs. 
There is little or no differentiation of the external spaces 
around the buildings. 


(3) Slab-blocks 

This building form is often used in an_ isolated 
configuration. It can be extended both in length and height 
but allows little scope for variety among the room layouts. 
Differentiation of the surrounding areas is difficult.

2-4 flats,

Qa) Blocks 


(4) Large-scale developments 

By expanding and interconnecting slab buildings to create 
large forms stretching out over a wide area it is possible to 
develop large tracts. Differentiation between spaces defined 
by the buildings is almost impossible to achieve. 


(5) Point-blocks 

These are distinctive individual buildings, often standing 
isolated in open spaces. A ‘dominant element’ in town 
planning, this building type is frequently designed in 
combination with low-rise developments.

MULTISTOREY HOUSING 


Developments with only one dwelling per floor » @ (the 
basic form for town houses) are often uneconomical. Four- 
storey buildings without lifts are the usual form. 

Housing with two dwellings per floor around a central 
core + (2) provides a good balance between living quality 
and economy, allowing a variety of plans with satisfactory 
solar orientation and flats with different numbers of rooms. 
Buildings up to four storeys can have stairs only whereas 
those with five or more require a lift. For flats over a height 
of 22m, high-rise building conditions apply. 

Having three dwellings per floor and a central staircase 
~ (3) again offers a good mix of economy and living quality, 
and this form is suitable for building corner units. Two-, 
three- and four-roomed dwellings can be considered. 
Housing with four dwellings per floor and a shared 
staircase > @) requires appropriate planning to provide a 
satisfactory relationship between economy and living 
quality. Different types of flat on each floor are possible. 

With point-blocks - &) the three-dimensional design is 
determined by the plan form.

BALCONIES 


Balconies offer an effective means of improving the attractiveness of 
domestic accommodation units. They also give an extended work 
Space as well as an easily supervised outdoor children’s play area. 
Typical uses include relaxation, sunbathing, sleeping, reading, 
eating etc. 

In addition to the required functional living space an area for 
plant boxes should be provided wherever possible — (8) + (14). 

Corner balconies — (1) offer privacy and good shelter and are 
therefore preferable to open balconies. Open balconies require a 
protective screen on the side facing the prevailing wind > (2). 

Where there are groups of balconies (as in blocks of flats), 
screens should be used to ensure privacy and give shelter from the 
wind > @). Even better is to separate the balconies with part of the 
structure because this makes it possible to include some storage 
space (e.g. for balcony furniture, sunshade etc.) > @) + 42. 

Loggias are justifiable in hot climates but are inappropriate in 
cooler countries. They only get the sunshine for a short time and 
Cause an increase in the external wall areas of the adjacent rooms, 
which increases heat loss > (6). Balconies which are offset in their 
elevation can make facades less severe but it is difficult to provide 
privacy and protection from the weather and sun -> 6). Balconies 
which are offset in their plan layout on the other hand offer excellent 
privacy and shelter — (7). 

During planning specify:

The balcony frame is best made from light steel profiles or tubes 
with a good anchorage in the masonry. Balcony balusters made 
from vertical steel rods (note that horizontal rods can be climbed by 
children) can be considered but are not desirable because they do 
not offer shelter from the wind and lack privacy. Where they are 
used, they are often covered by the tenants themselves with all sorts 
of different materials. 

Draughts can occur in the intermediate spaces between parapets 
and the concrete slab — @), so it is better to extend the parapet down 
in front of the balcony slab or to have a solid parapet. This must be

ACCESS CORRIDORS/DECKS 


An alternative to the centralised layout (1.e. buildings with 
dwellings on each floor around a central staircase or lift) is 
to have the dwellings accessed from an internal corridor 
or a covered external walkway. This is more economical in 
large housing projects. Each level is served by one or 
more vertical connection points (lifts and/or stairs) which 
also lead to the main entrance to the building. In addition 
to stairways and lifts, vertical systems of service shafts are 
needed and there should be a clear differentiation of built- 
in, added and free-standing constructions. > @) 

Dwellings on either side of an interior corridor have a 
single orientation and this makes it desirable to employ a 
design that uses two or more levels = @). A similar 
arrangement can be exploited in buildings with an access 
deck running along the exterior > 6) + @. Note that open 
access decks can cause problems in harsh climates. 

It is considerably better if the dwelling is on two or 
more levels because it allows the functional requirements 
to be met more satisfactorily and half-storey split levels, 
for example, can be stacked easily > @). Dwellings on only 
one level are particularly suitable as studio flats > ©). 

To improve the realtionship between circulation and 
dwelling areas the goal should be to minimise the length 
of horizontal access routes. Planning corridors on 
alternate floors provides the best arrangement for larger 
multi-level dwellings and good solutions can be attained 
by siting the deck access on alternate sides. The number 
of corridors can also be reduced with a mirrored 
staggering of maisonettes or a similar arrangement of 
split-level dwellings.

BUILDING FOR DISABLED PEOPLE 


An environment for disabled people needs to be designed 
to accommodate wheelchairs and allow sufficient space for 
moving around in safety (see ()-@) and ()-2 for 
dimensions and area requirements). Example door and 
corridor widths are given in (3)- (6. All switches, handles, 
window fittings, telephone points, paper roll or towel 
holders, lift controls, etc. must be within reach of an 
outstretched arm Q)-(2. The layout of the WC, in 
particular, requires careful planning: assess how many 
doors, light switches etc. are needed. Consider technical 
aids (e.g. magnetic catches on doors and remote controls). 

Access paths to the building should be 1.20-—2.00 m wide 
and be as short as possible. Ramps should ideally be 
straight, with a maximum incline of 5-7%, and should be no 
longer than 6m (). The ramp width between the handrails 
should be 1.20m. Corridors should be at least 1.30 m 
(preferably 2.00m) wide; clear opening of doors, 0.95m; 
height of light switches and electrical sockets, 1.00-1.05 m 
(use switches and control devices which have large buttons 
or surfaces). 

During urban planning, consideration should also be 
given to providing wheelchair users with easy access to 
general amenities such as supermarkets, restaurants, post 
offices, pharmacies, doctors’ surgeries, car parks, public 
transport etc.

BUILDING FOR DISABLED PEOPLE 


Houses and Apartments 


Accessibility: In the rented residential sector, access via 
corridors is the most common layout. This enables large 
numbers of angles and corners to be avoided; a straight main 
corridor is preferable. The entrance area should be of an 
appropriate size, with shelves and coat hooks planned in. The 
minimum area of entrance halls is 1.50 x 1.50m, and 1.70 x 1.60 
m for a porch with a single-leaf door. (It should be noted, 
however, that minimum recommended dimensions are often not 
very generous and in practice can prove to be too small.) For 
blind residents it is important to have an intercom system at the 
apartment door and the building’s main entrance. 


Living area: Living rooms should allow adequate free 
movement for wheelchair users and have sufficient space for two 
or three more visitors’ wheelchairs. For blind people, additional 
space should be provided for their literature and tape equipment: 
Braille books and newspapers are roughly three times bulkier 
than their printed equivalents. Single disabled people need more 
space than those in shared households. In apartments, 
recommended minimum areas for living rooms with a dining 
area are: 22 m2 for one person; 24 m2 for two to four people; 
26 m2 for five; and 28 m2 for six. The minimum room width is 
3.75m for a one- or two-person home — (5). 

If an additional study area is to be incorporated, the floor area 
must be increased by at least 2 m2. 


Kitchen: Ergonomic planning is of great importance in the 
kitchen to allow disabled people to utilise their capabilities to the 
full. The arrangement of the storage, preparation, cooking and 
washing areas should be convenient and streamlined. The 
cooker, main worksurface and taps should be placed as close 
together as possible. Storage spaces must be accessible to 
wheelchair users (i.e. no high cupboards). The reach of the arm 
is roughly 600mm horizontally and between 400 and 1400mm 
vertically. The optimal working height must be adapted to suit 
each disabled person, within the range 750-900 mm, so it is 
desirable to have a simple adjustment mechanism. 


Single-family houses: The single-storey family house with 
garden is often the preferred form of residence for disabled 
people. Their requirements can be satisfied easily in this type of 
accommodation: t.e. no steps at the entrance and no difference in 
level between the individual rooms and the garden; rooms can be 
connected without doors and custom designed to best suit the 
residents. However, two-storey family houses can also be 
suitable, even for wheelchair users, if a suitable means of moving 
between floors (vertical elevator or stair lift) is incorporated. 


Multi-apartment dwellings: The grouping of apartments in 
multiple occupancy dwellings is a housing solution that offers 
disabled people an environment which is both sociable and 
supportive. In economic terms, it is rarely possible to convert 
Ordinary apartments into adequate homes for the severely 
disabled, so they need to be included at the preliminary planning 
stage. It is once again preferable to situate apartments for 
disabled people at ground-floor level to avoid the necessity of 
installing lifts/elevators.

BUILDING FOR DISABLED PEOPLE 


Conversions 


The needs of disabled people are often not taken into account 
sufficiently in new building projects, so it is frequently necessary to 
convert existing residential units into appropriate apartments. 
Suitable buildings have a generous floor area and offer simple 
opportunities for alteration in accordance with the occupant's needs. 
The conversion measures required can include: alterations to the 
plan, including building work (which is limited by structural 
considerations, the type of construction and floor area); alterations to 
services, bathroom and kitchen fittings etc.; and supplementary 
measures, such as the installation of ramps, lifts and additional 
electrical equipment. Attention should also be paid to access from the 
street, any floor coverings which require changing and the creation of 
a car parking space with ample allowances for wheelchair users. The 
extent of the alterations depends on the degree of disability of the 
residents and the specific activity within the apartment. As a result, 
the conversion measures will often be specified in conjunction with 
the disabled person and tailored to his or her needs. 

Prior to commencing conversion work, the plan and structure of 
the existing apartment should be examined carefully. Ground floor 
apartments of an adequate size are particularly suitable because 
additional services (passing through the basement) can be installed 
more cheaply and entrance modifications are easier. 


Extent of the conversion work: Three groups of disabled people 
can be identified, each with corresponding requirements: 

¢ Disabled members of a family (husbands, wives, children) who 
go to work or school outside the home. Alterations in such 
cases relate to access to the house/apartment, furnishings and 
provision of sufficient freedom of movement in the living and 
sleeping areas, and specially adapted facilities in the 
bathroom/WC. 

¢ Disabled persons who carry out household tasks. Here, 
additional alterations must be made to the kitchen and 
elsewhere to simplify work in the home. 

¢ Severely disabled persons who are only partially independent, 
if at all, and thus require permanent care. Extra space must be 
provided for manoeuvring wheelchairs and facilities to aid the 
work of carers should be added. Note that self-propelled 
wheelchairs require most space. 


Comparison of sizes of living area: While apartments for the 
elderly are no larger in area than standard apartments (any changes 
consisting only of adjusting door widths and tailoring the functional 
areas), living areas for disabled people need to be increased 
appropriately, particularly for wheelchair users and the visually 
impaired. Regulations often require additional rooms in these 
apartments as well as a modified bathroom with WC for wheelchair 
users. 

Recommended values for habitable areas are: 45-50 m2 for a one- 
person household; 50-55 m2 for two people.

BARRIER-FREE LIVING 


A functionally efficient and well-designed living space is of great 
importance to people with disabilities. To turn through 180° a 
wheelchair user requires 1500-1700 mm. This requirement sets the 
minimum sizes and circulation space of landings, rooms, garages 
etc. shown here. Entrances should not have a threshold or steps and 
revolving doors are not permitted. Doors should have at least 
900mm clear width. Bathroom/WC doors must open outwards. The 
minimum width for a landing is 1500mm, and landings of over 15m 
in length should include a circulation area (1800 x 1800 mm). All 
levels and facilities inside and outside a building must be accessible 
without negotiating steps; if necessary, include a lift > (13) Or ramps

OLD PEOPLE’S ACCOMMODATION 


Depending on the degree of support required, there are three 
main types of accommodation and care for the elderly: (1) old 
people’s housing, (2) old people’s homes and (3) nursing homes. 

In the United Kingdom, depending, inter alia, on type of 
dwelling and facilities provided, housing for elderly people can 
be classified into: category one housing, category two 
housing, sheltered housing, very sheltered housing, retirement 
housing, extra-care housing, residential care homes, nursing 
care homes, and dual registration homes. In the United States, 
although similar building types have been developed, the 
terminology differs. The building types that house elderly 
people in the United States can be described as independent 
retirement housing units, congregate housing, personal care 
housing, skilled nursing home, and life care communities. 

Old people’s housing > ©) - &) consists of self-contained 
flats or apartments which cater for the needs of the elderly so 
that they can avoid moving into an old people’s home for as 
long as possible. Such housing is usually scattered around 
residential areas, with a density of 2-10%. Flats for one person 
are 25-35m2; for two people 45-55m2. Sheltered balconies 
>3m2. 

Sheltered housing is generally a group of flats (each 
>20m2) in one building, with common rooms and a tea 
kitchen. A good solution is to build these facilities close to a 
nursing home for the elderly which offers meals, leisure, 
recreation and various therapies. Provide one car parking 
space per 5-8 residents. Note that heating costs will be 2% 
higher than normal. 

Old people’s homes offer residential care facilities and 
must conform to regulations on planning, licensing. The large 
amount of ancillary space required means the most economic 
size is about 120 places. Meals, entertainment and therapies 
are provided and an integrated nursing section for short-term 
care. General design features: stairs 16/30cm without open 
riser; edges of steps defined with a colour; handrails on both 
sides of stairs and in corridors; where necessary, lifts for 
moving patients on stretchers or in folding chairs. The 
buildings should all be adapted for the disabled and have 
open spaces with benches. 

Homes should be sited close to the infrastructure of a town 
or village and to public transport. The inclusion of a daycare 
centre should be considered to provide opportunities for 
people living independently to make contact and receive non- 
residential care (approximately one daycare centre is needed 
per 1600 elderly people).

OLD PEOPLE’S ACCOMMODATION 


Nursing homes for the elderly provide care for people who 
are chronically ill and in need of medica! attention. The 
residential area consists of a 50:50 split of single and double 
rooms > @ - @. It must be clearly separated from the 
administration and office areas > ©). Residents are 
frequently split into groups consisting of 8-10 people, with 
a shared lounge and possibly a tea kitchen where meals 
may also be eaten = ©). Provide one treatment room per 
two groups. 

Central facilities are best grouped together on ground 
floor. Rooms are required for administration, consultation, 
Occupational therapy, physiotherapy, chiropody. In 
addition, rooms for entertainment, common rooms, 
cafeteria and hairdressing should be provided. 


Some key issues affecting design 

When considering building layout, measures will be 
required to reduce the risk of cross-infection. Changes in 
level are best avoided but if this is not possible, ramps must 
be provided inside and outside building. Circulation 
distances for residents should be kept to a minimum and all 
main routes will need handrails. Corridors must be wide 
enough to allow two people in wheelchairs or walking with 
frames to pass each other comfortably. 

Careful interior design is necessary. Doors must not 
restrict the residents’ ability to get around; automatic 
Opening may be required. Furniture and fittings must be 
suitable for older people. 

Consistent temperatures are required and contingency 
plans for providing heating in the event of power failures 
should be considered. The ability to control temperature 
and sunlight penetration, particularly in bedrooms and 
sitting rooms, is important to residents. Hot pipes and 
heaters must be protected: the maximum acceptable 
surface temperature is around 43°C. 

Hot water systems must be designed to resist infection 
such as that causing Legionnaire’s disease.

SCHOOLS 


Cloakroom facilities can be decentralised by allocating 
space outside the classrooms but directly linked to them. 
The number of toilets, urinals and wash-basins required, 
based on total number of pupils and separated according 
to sex, should be as set out in the local school building 
guidelines (e.g. > (i). Sanitary installations with direct 
daylight and ventilation are preferable, and there must be 
separate entrances for boys and girls. Examples of 
different toilet facilities for schools are shown in @)- ©. 

Horizontal and vertical circulation usually doubles as 
an emergency escape route. Escape routes must have a 
clear width of min. 1m/150 people, but min. width of 
corridors in classroom areas is 2.00m or 1.25m for less 
than 180 people. Stairs in classroom areas must be 
1.25m, other escape routes 1.00m. Max. length of escape 
routes: 25m measured in a straight line from the stairwell 
door to the furthest workplace, or 30m in an indirect line 
to the centre of the room. Capacity of stairs is dependent 
On number of users, average occupancy, etc. Width of 
stairs: 0.80m/100 people (minimum 1.25m, max. 2.50m). 
Alternatively: 0.10m/15 people. (Only the top floor is 
calculated at 100% occupancy, remaining floors at 50%.) 

General-purpose teaching area includes standard 
classrooms, supplementary classrooms, extra-large 
classrooms, rooms for special courses, rooms for 
teaching languages and social studies, language labs, 
rooms for teaching material, maps and other ancillary 
rooms. 

Space requirements: classroom for traditional teaching 
2.00 m2/pupil; for teaching in sets 3.00m2/pupil, for open 
plan teaching 4.50m2/place including ancillary areas 
needed for each subject. 

Standard room shape: rectangular or square (12x20, 
12x16, 12x12, 12x10); with a max. room depth of 7.20m 
it is possible to have windows on one side only. > % 

Floor areas are: traditional classroom, 1.80-2.00 m2/ 
pupil; open plan 3.00-5.00m2/pupil. The clear height 
should be 2.70-3.40m. 

Language labs should be within or directly related to 
the general-purpose teaching area, and close to media 
centre and library. Approximately 30 language lab. places 
per 1000 pupils will be needed > @) - @). The size of LT 
(listen/talk) and LSR (listen/talk/record) labs is approx. 
80m2: booths 1x2m, number of places/lab. 24-30, i.e. 
48-60 m2, plus ancillary spaces (e.g. studio, recording 
room, archive for teachers’ and pupils’ tapes). Artificially- 
lit internal language labs with an environmental control 
system are also possible.

SCHOOLS 


Library, media centre and central amenities: 
Purpose: information centre for classwork, further 
education and leisure and may be used by pupils, teachers 
and non-school users. 

Library includes a conventional school library for pupils 
and teachers with books and magazines, lending facilities, 
reading and work places. The media centre is an extension 
of the library with recording and playback facilities for 
radio, film, TV, i.e. audio-visual equipment and a 
corresponding stock of software, microfilm and microfiche 
facilities. 

Standard space requirement overall: library/media 
centre 0.35-0.55 m2/pupil. Broken down into: 


¢ book issues and returns, 5m? per workplace, and 
catalogue space of 20-40 m2 

¢ information: librarian, media advisor, media 
technician, etc. 10-20m2 per person 


Compact book storage in 1000 volume stacks at 20-30 
volumes/metre run of shelving. Free access bookcase 
approx. 4m2 including circulation space, reading places 
and catalogues. For 1000 volumes reference books 
20-40m2, study area generally per 1000 volumes 
reference books 25 m2 for 5% of the pupils/teachers, but at 
least 30 study spaces at 2m2 each, i.e. 60m2 carrels 
2.5-3.0m2. Room for work in groups of 8-10, 20m2 
=> dd) oe 2). 

For kitchen and ancillary rooms, the size and equipment 
specification depends on the catering system. Table service 
for food and table clearing for young children (portions 
possibly served by teacher), otherwise self-service (e.g. 
from conveyer belt, counter, cafeteria line or free-flow 
system). Distribution capacity of 5-15 meals/minute or 
250-1000/ hour, variable staffing levels. Space required for 
distribution systems 40-60m2. Dining room size depends 
on number of pupils and number of sittings, min. of 
1.20-1.40 m2 per place. Larger spaces should be divided up. 
For every 40 places, 1 wash-basin in the entrance area

SCHOOLS 
Open-plan 


Nowadays, it is often considered normal for offices to be 
open plan. This sometimes influences school architecture. 
The two have similar requirements regarding size of room, 
lighting, ventilation, acoustics, floor and ceiling finishes, 
furniture, and colour. 

Main advantage: flexibility = @ + @. Team teaching in 
groups of up to 100 pupils. Space per pupil (not incl. core) 
3.4m2-4 m2. 

The later addition of partitions should be possible — (@). 
There are many US examples. German model example: 
Tannenberg School, Seeheim -» @). However, vertical 
drainpipes and service ducts, etc. are a problem because of 
the need to fix sound-insulating partitions = @. Ceiling 
panels should be removable so that services in the ceiling 
void are accessible —> (5). 

Large groups of 40-50 pupils, divided into medium-sized 
groups of 25-26 pupils, small groups of 10 pupils — @). 

Planning grid 1.20 x 1.20m throughout; clear room 
height 3m. Movable partitions which can be taken down 
provide a solution for the transition from old fixed 
classrooms to open plan > @). Also, building forms which 
create small spaces > @) + @ and > © - ©. Examples of 
seating arrangement for watching films, slides etc > G)- 40. 

Educational experts maintain that, during conscious 
learning, people best retain information that they have 
obtained themselves, more precisely: 


10% of what they read; 

20% of what they hear; 

30% of what they see; 

50% of what they hear and see; 

70% of what they say themselves; and 

90% of what they do themselves involving their own actions.

FURTHER EDUCATION COLLEGES 


Technical colleges and colleges of further education 
The type of college depends on regional and local factors, 
so that it is not really possible to give absolute sizes for 
systems. The figures cover both part-time and full-time 
students; as an approximate guidelines, and depending on 
the area served, there are 2000-6000 pupils per 
60000-150000 inhabitants. Owing to the large catchment 
areas, the schools should be well served by public 
transport. Site: at least 10m? per part-time student and at 
least 25m? per full-time student of college site area, as far 
as possible free of pollution from noise, smoke, odour and 
dust. Ensure a good-shaped site and the possibility for 
extension. Arrangement on the site, type of construction 
and building design depend on the sizes of the spaces that 
can be accommodated on several levels (classrooms for 
general subjects, specialist subjects, administration) and 
those which cannot - areas for non-academic work, e.g. 
workshops or sports areas. College buildings are, as a rule, 
2-3 storeys, higher only in exceptional cases. Workshop 
buildings with heavy machines or frequent deliveries are 
single storey only. 

Access: entrance area and foyer with central facilities 
used as circulation space connecting horizontal and vertical 
movement as in general school centres or comprehensive 
schools. Teaching areas divided according to type of 
teaching and their space requirements. General-purpose 
teaching areas occupy 10-20% of the space. General 
classrooms as normal with 50-60m2, small classrooms 
45-50m2, oversize classrooms 85m2, possibly open-plan 
classrooms doubling as a film or lecture hall of 100-200 m2. 

Building requirements, furnishings and fittings basically 
the same as for general school centres and comprehensive 
schools. An assembly room of 20m2 per 5 normal classes.

Lecture Theatres 


It is preferable to group larger lecture theatres for central 
lectures in separate complexes. Smaller lecture theatres for 
lectures on specialist subjects are better in the individual 
department and institute buildings. Access to the lecture theatre 
is separated from the research facilities, with short routes and 
entrances from outside at the back of the lecture hall: for raked 
seating entrances can be behind the top row and larger theatres 
can also have them in the centre on each side +» 3) + 6. 
Lecturers enter at the front, from the preparation room, from 


where equipment carrying the experimental animals can also be 
trollied into the lecture theatre. 


Usual sizes for lecture theatres: 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 600, 
800 seats. Theatres with up to 200 seats have a ceiling height of 
3.50m and are integrated into the departmental buildings, if 


larger they are better in a separate building. 
e 


Lecture theatres for subjects involving writing on 
chalkboards and projection have seating on shallow rake 


Demonstration lecture theatres for science subjects have 

experiment benches and seating steeply raked p. 315 5 

° Medical demonstration lecture theatres, ‘anatomy 
theatres’, have steeply raked seating -> p. 315 6)

Lecture Theatres 


Seating in lecture theatres: combined units of tip-up or 
swing seats, backrest and writing ledge (with shelf or hook 
for folders), usually fixed > @)- @). 

Seating arrangement depending on subject, number of 
students and teaching method: slide lectures, electro- 
acoustic systems on a gentle rake; surgery, internal 
medicine, physics on a steep rake. View curve calculated 
using graphic or analytic methods -» @- ©. 

Amount of space per student depends on the type of 
seat, depth of writing shelf and rake of floor. 

Amount of space per student: for seating in comfort 
70x65cm; and on average 60x80 = 55x75cm. 0.60m2 
needed per student including all spaces in larger lecture 
theatres under the most cramped conditions: in smaller 
lecture theatres and in average comfort 0.80-0.95 m2. (Cont.

COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 


Sabie Pee Experiment benches suitable for laboratory work should, if 
8 r possible, be interchangeable units on castors and must be 
U one eiele provided with a power point. 


Projection screens and boards can be designed as a 
segmented, curved wall or simply fixed to a flat end-wall. 
Wall blackboards are usually made up of several sections 
which can be moved up and down manually or 
mechanically. They can be designed to drop down beneath 
the projection area. Blackboards on wheels can also be 
considered.

Acoustics and lighting 

Sound should reach each member of the audience with 
equal amplitude without any echo. Suspended ceilings for 
reflection and absorption. Rear walls lined with sound- 
absorbent material, other walls smooth. Light level in a 
windowless lecture theatre: 600Ix.

Related additional spaces 

Each lecture theatre should have an ancillary room, with no 
fixed function which can also be used for storage. In lecture 
theatres where animal experiments are performed 
sufficient space for preparation should be provided. It 
should be on the same level and close to the stage. 
Standard minimum size for a rectangular shaped lecture 
theatre: 0.2-0.25m2/seat; for trapezoidal shape: 
0.15-0.18m2/seat. For scientific and pre-clinical lectures: 
0.2-0.3 m2/seat. 

Spaces for storage and service rooms are essential for 
the proper running of a lecture theatre complex: a service 
room for the technical staff servicing the equipment in the 
lecture theatres, a service room for cleaners, storeroom for 
spare parts, light bulbs, fluorescent-light tubes, 
chalkboards, clothes, etc. Minimum room size 15 m2, overall

LABORATORIES 


Laboratories differ according to type of use and discipline. 


According to use: 

Laboratories for teaching and practicals, comprising a large 
number of workstations, usually with simple basic 
equipment. > @) Research labs are usually in smaller spaces 
with special equipment and additional rooms for activities 
such as weighing and measuring, centrifuges and 
autoclaves, washing up, climatised and cold storage rooms 
with constant temperature, photographic rooms/dark 
rooms, etc. > ©). 


According to subject: 

Chemistry and biology labs with fixed benches. Rooms 
have frequent air exchange, often additional fume 
cupboards (digestors) for work which produces gas or 
smoke. Digestors often in separate rooms. Physics labs 
mainly with movable benches and a range of electrical 
installations in trunking in the wall or suspended from the 
ceiling; few air changes. Special labs for specific 
requirements, e.g. isotope labs for work with radioactive 
substance in differing safety categories. Clean-room labs 
~+ @ for work needing dust-free filtered air, e.g. in the field 
of microelectronics or for particularly dangerous 
substances, which should be prevented from entering 
surrounding rooms by separate air circulation and filtering 
systems (microbiology, genetic engineering, safety levels 
L1-L4).

LABORATORIES 


Unserviced work rooms are also part of the lab area: 

Study cells, service rooms for lab. personnel. Also 
central rooms such as general storerooms, chemicals stores 
and supplies with special protective equipment, isotope 
stores with cooling containers, etc. Experimental animals 
are kept in a special location. Particular kinds of equipment 
are needed, depending on the type of animal and they have 
differing requirements for separate air circulation. 


Lab workstation 

The bench, fixed or movable, is the module which 
determines the lab workstation; its measurements, 
including work space and passage space, form the so-called 
lab axis, the basic spatial unit. Normal measurements for 
standard workbench: 120cm width for practicals, several 
times this for a research lab, 80cm depth of work surface 
including energy conduit » (5) ~ (6). 

Benches and fume cupboards are usually part of a 
modular system, width of elements 120cm, fume 
cupboards 120 and 180cm _. (7). The conduit carries all the 
supply systems; benches and low cupboard are placed in 
front of it »-G@)-™. 

Benches are made of steel tubing, with work-surfaces of 
stoneware panels without joints, less frequently tiles, or 
chemical-resistant plastic panels. Low cupboards are of 
wood or chipboard with plastic laminate. Supply services 
are from above from the ceiling void, or from below 
through the floor structure. 


Ventilation: 
Low-pressure or high-pressure systems, the latter are 
recommended particularly in multi-storey buildings for 
institutes with higher air requirement in order to reduce the 
cross-sections of the ducts. Cooling and humidification as 
required. Ventilation systems have the highest space 
requirement of all services. 
Labs where chemicals are used must have artificial air 

supply and extraction. Air changes per hour: 

chem. labs 8 

biology labs 4 

physics labs 3-4 (in extraction area) 


Electrical services: 

Where a high number of connections and special supplies 
of electricity are required, a separate transformer in the 
building is essential. Electrical plant must be in a fireproof 
enclosure without any other cables running through it.

Horizontal services system 











LABORATORIES 


There are various possible arrangements of service ducts, 
columns and vertical circulation cores: 


() Services concentrated in internal main shafts at each 
end of the building, vertical circulation core inside 


(2) Services concentrated in external shafts at each end 
of the building, vertical circulation core outside 


(3) Services concentrated in main shafts centrally in each 
part, circulation core as link element 


(4) Services distributed in discrete duct installations, 
vertical circulation core inside 


(5) Main services inside linked to vertical circulation core 


©) Service shaft outside, vertical circulation core off- 
centre. 


Vertical services system 

There are many vertical service ducts inside the building or 
on the facade, taking the services directly into the labs in 
separate ducts: decentrally distributed air supply and 
exhaust air to fume cupboards, separate ventilators on the 
roof. 


Advantages: 
Maximum supply to individual workplaces. Short, 
horizontal connections to the bench. 


Disadvantages: 
Plan flexibility limited, more space needed on services plant 
floor = %. 


Horizontal services system 

Vertical main services concentrated in shafts and 
distributed from there horizontally via the service plant 
floors to the bench by connections from above or below. 


Advantages: 

Fewer conduits and less space needed for the services 
ducts, greater flexibility of plan, easier maintenance, central 
ventilation plants, later installation easier > (@). High density 
of services requires more space. Vertical mains ducts with 
concentrated services are more manageable, access is

LABORATORIES 


Rooms are used according to a schedule of accommodation 
and plan. Rooms with natural or artificial light and 
ventilation, with high or low servicing, allow the creation of 
zones of differing use and technical qualities. For this 
reason laboratory buildings often have large internal areas 
(with two corridors) -» 4) + @). The building length depends 
on the longest reasonable horizontal run of wet services. 
Services floors for plant in the basement or at roof level. 


Grid for structure and fittings: 

For adaptability of use, a reinforced concrete frame 
Structure, pre-cast Or poured in-situ, is preferable. The main 
structural grid is a multiple of the typical planning grid of 
120 x 120cm (decimal system). A convenient structural grid 
for a large proportion of rooms without columns is: 7.20 < 
7.20m, 7.20 x 8.40m, 8.40 x 8.40m. Storey height normally 
4m, clear room height up to 3.0m. 

Columns stands on the grid off-set from the planning 
grid to increase the flexibility of the servicing. Separation is 
by a system of partitions and suspended ceilings which 
enclose the rooms. Movable dividing walls should be easy 
to assemble and have chemical-resistant surfaces. Ceilings 
should be designed to be disassembled and should absorb 
sound. Floor coverings should be water- and chemical- 
resistant, without joints and be poor electrical conductors: 
as a rule welded plastic sheet or tiles. 

Provide viewing windows into the labs from the corridor 
or in the doors. 

Isotope labs have smooth surfaced walls and ceilings 
without pores, rounded corners, shielded in lead or 
concrete, waste water monitoring, with shower cubicles 
between the lab and exits. Concrete container for active 
waste and refuse, concrete safe with lead doors, etc. 

A weighing table is part of every lab, usually in a 
separate balance room. Benches lie along the wall in front 
of vibration-free walls.

CHILD DAYCARE CENTRES 


Child daycare centres provide social and educational facilities 
for daytime care of pre-school children and school children up 
to the age of 15. Children’s needs should be taken into 
consideration in the planning. Division according to age groups: 

Creche from 8 months to 3 years, groups of 6~8 children; 
kindergarten from 3 years to school age groups of 25-30 
children; children’s after-school care centre from 6-15 years, 
groups of 25-30 children. If possible, provision should be made 
for age groups to be combined. The centre should be near 
housing and traffic-free. 

Size of rooms, schedule of accommodation and details 
> 7) +@Q). 

Creche 2-3m2 floor space/child (babies, crawlers and 
toddlers) plus spaces for: nappy changing table, playpens, 
cupboards, toy racks, child-size tables and chairs. 

Kindergarten 1.5-3m2 floor space/child. 15-30 children/ 
room plus spaces for cupboards, toy racks, child-size tables and 
chairs, chalkboards, etc. 

After-school care centre 1.5-4m?2 floor space/child. 20 
children/room plus spaces for cupboards, toy racks, child-size 
tables and chairs, chalkboards, storage facilities, homework 
room with cupboard for teaching material, shelves, desks and 
chairs. Arts and crafts room with cupboard for tools and 
materials, workbench, carpentry bench, etc. 

With more than two group rooms a multipurpose room is 
required, preferably next to the group rooms and with a view of 
them. Good sound insulation, so as to help concentration in 
group learning processes, e.g. play rehearsals, etc. 

If the room is large enough (min. 60m2) it can also be used 
as a gymnasium and for afternoon naps. Apparatus store. 

There is a trend towards two-storey buildings with staircases 
and emergency stairs, especially in high-density urban areas; and 
child daycare centres with longer opening hours for working or 
single parents (07.30 — 17.00). Facilities for disabled children, WCs 
and washrooms accessible to wheelchairs, therapy room. Min. 6 
parking spaces and space for bicycles and prams. 

Driveway and parking for staff and people collecting 
children, playground.

PLAYGROUNDS 


Play makes a fundamental contribution to the development 
of a child’s personality. It is mainly through play that small 
children adapt to their environment. Play areas must be 
varied, changing and changeable. They must meet 
children’s needs. Play is a social experience, through it 
children learn to understand the consequences of their 
behaviour. 

Requirements of play areas: traffic safety, no pollution, 
adequate sunshine, ground water level not too high. 

Play areas should be focal points within residential areas 
and should be connected to residential and other areas by 
simple networks of paths. They should not be pushed out 
on to the periphery but planned in connection with 
communication systems. Guidelines for planning 
playgrounds take into account the following data: age 
group, usable space per person, play area size, distance 
from dwellings, etc. 


distance from home 
(m) (minutes) 


110 — 230 
350 - 450 
700 — 1000 





When building housing, private outdoor playgrounds in the 
grounds of the housing complex should be provided for 
younger children up to the age of 6, for children from 6-12 
and for adults. A basis for calculating the size of all public 
playgrounds can often be found in planning regulations. 
For example, 5m? play area per housing unit, minimum size 
of playground 40m2. Open spaces for play must be 
enclosed by a barrier at least 1m high (dense hedge, fences, 
etc.) to protect them from roads, parked cars, railway lines, 
deep water, precipices and other sources of danger.

LIBRARIES 


Libraries perform a range of functions in society. 
Academic libraries, for example, obtain, collect and store 
literature for education and research purposes, and are 
usually Open to the general public. Public libraries 
provide communities with a wide choice of more general 
literature and other information media, with as much as 
possible displayed on open shelves. The functions of 
academic and public libraries are often combined in a 
single library in larger towns. National libraries, for 
example, may house collections of literature and 
historical documentation produced in one country or 
region (deposit copies) and are open to the public, 
whereas specialist libraries for the collection of literature 
and media in limited subject areas often have limited 
access. 

In academic libraries, reference rooms are provided. 
There may also be counters for loans from the closed 
stacks, and free access to the open shelves of magazines, 
books or separately presented educational material in 
reading rooms. Apart from books and journals, almost all 
the different information media forms are collected and 
presented for use in an accessible way. The number of 
reading places depends on the number of students in the 
various subjects. The information is arranged in a 
systematic way, i.e. by subject. The services offered 
include inter-library loans as well as photocopying, and 
reading and printing from microforms (microfiche and 
microfilm). In addition, an on-line literature search and a 
literature search on data bases stored on CD-ROM are 
available. 

University libraries are organised in either one or two 
layers. The one-layer system is administered centrally 
(book processing and services) and normally has very few 
separate branch or subject libraries. The two-layer system 
includes a central library and usually a large number of 
faculty, subject and institute libraries. The stock is held on 
open shelves in reading rooms, or in accessible book 
stacks (with the same shelf spacing as in closed stacks), 
as well as_in_ restricted-access closed _ stacks. 
Arrangements such as these are found in various 
proportions in almost all academic libraries. The 
proportions of loan (open and closed access) and 
reference stocks depend on the type of organisation, i.e. 
the aims of the library and the form of the buildings often 
have a significant effect. The number of book shelves 
depends on the type of organisation, accessibility for 
users, type of shelving (fixed or mobile), the system of 
subject ordering in use and its method of installation, the 
separation of different formats and also the structural grid 
of the building >= @ -@. 

Reading room areas, with space for reading and 
working, should be easily accessible and therefore 
situated on as few levels as possible. This also aids book 
transport. There should be a clear directional system 
with easily read signs giving directions to services and 
book shelves. Avoid offset levels. Access to the 
Operational areas and reading rooms on different floors 
should be by staircase, but lifts must also be provided for 
the use of disabled people and for book transport. Floor 
loadings in the operational and reading areas should be 
> 5.0kN/m2. 

Circulation routes should be >1.2m wide, and clear 
spaces between shelves at least 1.3-1.4m wide (or in 
accordance with local regulations). Avoid crossings and 
overlapping of routes for users, staff and book transport. 
Access to reading rooms can be through control gates 
equipped with book security equipment and, if possible, 
only one entrance and exit. For functional reasons, the 
control gates should be near the lending desk/central 
information desk.

Facilities inside the controlled area should include reading 
room information, bibliographies, on-line catalogue terminals, 
the issue and return of books which can only be used in the 
reading room, copying equipment (in separate rooms), open- 
access book shelves, work spaces and, if necessary, the open- 
access book stacks. 

Facilities outside the controlled area should include 
cloakrooms or briefcase and coat lockers, toilets, a cafeteria, a 
newspaper reading area, an exhibition room, lecture and 
conference rooms (possibly for use outside library opening 
hours), an information desk (central enquiries), card and 
microfiche indexes, on-line catalogue terminals, book return 
and a collection area for ordered/reserved books. 








LIBRARIES 


The provision of work spaces in college libraries depends on 
the number of students and the distribution of individual 
subject groups. Special work places are required for people 
with disabilities (wheelchair users and the visually impaired) 
and for special operations (microform reading and enlarging 
equipment, PCs, terminals, use of CD-ROMs etc; take note of the 
relevant guidelines), as well as for individual study (cubicles, 
carrels, individual work rooms). Work spaces should preferably 
be in daylight areas. The area required for a simple 
reading/work place is 2.5m2; for a PC or individual work place, 
> 4.0m? is needed. 

Security is vitally important in user areas. Fire precautions 
must comply with national and local building regulations and 
procedures. The installation of a book security system will 
prevent theft, and the optimal security of unsupervised escape 
exits is achieved with automatic electronic lock-up when an 
alarm is triggered. Securing emergency doors mechanically with 
acoustic and/or visual alarms is less effective. 

The archive store is best situated in the basement because of 
the high floor loads and the more even climate. ‘Book towers’ are 
not convenient because of the increased need for climate control, 
transport and staff, as well as limited flexibility. The most efficient 
method is to have linked areas which are as large as possible 
without changes in level. The divisions between fixed stacks and 
those of mobile (compact) systems are dependent on the 
structural grid of the columns. Capacity can be increased by 
approx. 100% by using mobile stacks. The floor loading with 
fixed stacks is at least 7.5kN/m2; with mobile stacks it is at least 
12.5kN/m2. 

The internal climate in user areas should be 20° +2°C, with 
approx. 50 +5% relative air humidity and air changes (fresh 
replacement air) of 20m3 per hour per person. These values can 
be increased or reduced depending on the weather conditions. 
Avoid direct sunlight, since UV and heat radiation destroy paper 
and bindings. Because of the high energy consumption, and 
therefore high running costs, air conditioning should be 
introduced only where absolutely necessary. Natural ventilation 
is possible with narrow buildings. 

The internal climate in archive stores should be 18° +2°C, 
with 50 +5% relative air humidity and air changes (fresh 
replacement air) of >3m%h-'1m-1. Air filtration is necessary to 
eliminate any harmful substances in the atmosphere (e.g. dust, 
SO>, NO, etc.). By using wall materials with good moisture- and 
heat-retaining properties, it is possible to reduce the necessity 
for air conditioning. Slight air circulation is necessary to prevent 
the growth of mould, particularly with mobile stacks (use open 
ends). Special collections and materials (e.g. photographic 
slides, film, and sound and data media, as well as cards, plans 
and graphics) require a special internal climate. The internal 
environment should be appropriate to each area of the library, 
rather than being uniform throughout, and no open-plan offices 
should be sited in administrative areas. However, full 
environmental control is needed in stacks, because the building 
structure alone cannot provide suitable conditions 

Floor loading in administration and book-processing areas 
should be >5.0kN/mZ2. In technical areas (workshops), individual 
structural requirements will depend on the types of machinery 
and equipment. Reinforced concrete and steel-frame buildings 
with a structural grid of >7.20m x 7.20m have been found to be 
suitable owing to the flexibility they allow in fitting out. Room 
heights should be >3.00m. 

Transport books horizontally in book trolleys (avoid 
thresholds; changes of level should have ramps <6% or 
platform lifts) and/or on conveyer belts. Transport books 
vertically in lifts, on conveyer belts (the route must be planned 
very carefully, with sloping inclines; very low maintenance 
costs), by a container transport system (mechanically 
programmable, a combination of horizontal stretches and 
paternoster lifts) or by an automatic container transport system 
(routes can be horizontal and/or vertical as desired, fully 
automatic, generally computer-controlled; high investment 
cost, rather high running costs).

LIBRARIES 


A pneumatic tube system can convey 
information such as lending tickets. 
Modern systems tend to use plastic 
conveyors, running in plastic tubes, 
with comparatively small plants. 
Other methods of sending call-slip 
information to the stack as part of 
retrieval communication are faxes, 
gravity tubes and document carriers. 
A computer link between the request 
counter and the stack is also possible. 
Ideally, all material should be moved 
directly to where it is required. The 
return of books to their correct place 
on the shelf is very important. 

Lighting should be appropriate to 
the use to which the area is put. 
Bookshelves should be _ protected 
from daylight. Sensitive materials 
should not be exposed to a level 
>50Ix. Artificial light is preferable in 
an exhibition area since it is easier to 
control. The best illuminance distri- 
bution ratio at workstations is 10:3:1 
(book:surface:background). Non-work 
rooms need 100-300Ix, stacks need 
150-300Ix, office and administration 
blocks need 250—-500Ix, and reading 
rooms without individual lights and 
catalogue rooms need 300-850 ix. 
Lighting should have separate 
switches in each area and be 
individually adjustable at each work 
station. 

Building design should be based 
on climate, and internal environ- 
mental control should be based on the 
building. The recommended temp- 
erature for reading rooms and open 
access areas is 22°C in summer and 
20°C in winter, with 50-60% relative 
humidity and six or seven air changes 
per hour. Stacks should be kept at 
17-22°C in summer and 17°C in 
winter, with 50-60% relative humidity 
and six to seven air changes per hour. 
The recommended humidity level in 
libraries is between 45% and 55%. 
Special measures should be taken for 
unusual and_ sensitive materials; 
humidity which is too low or too high 
can damage films. The air should be 
changed at least three times per hour, 
depending on the area of the library 
and time of year. The air intake per 
cycle should preferably be 25%, but is 
often reduced to 15% for economic 
reasons.

LIBRARIES 


Public libraries offer general literature and _ other 
information media which are directly accessible on open 
shelves. Systematic collections and subject searches of 
material in print and in other media are limited to the larger 
public libraries. Public libraries have no academic collection 
obligations or archiving functions, and are usually without, 
or with only very small, archive stores. They are freely 
accessible to the public, and are used by children, 
adolescents and adults. Public libraries orientate their level 
and choice of stock and services to the needs of their users. 
As a communication ‘market-place’ for all population 
groups, in addition to the traditional provision of books, the 
library may have browsing” areas, a_ citizens’ 
advice/enquiries desk, a cafeteria, music listening facilities, 
recreation and meeting rooms, and study seating for 
groups and individuals. It may also include a music library, 
an art lending library and a mobile lending service. In 
addition to books and newspapers, the collection may 
include periodicals, brochures, games, or new media (CDs, 
videos, PC software) to be used in the library or borrowed. 

The room design should encourage adults, children and 
young people to spend time in separate open-plan spaces 
where activities take place. The floor area depends on the 
size of the collection. There should be 300 m2 of usable floor 
area for every 10000 units of media in the collection +» 2. 
The objective is to have a minimum of two media units per 
occupant. 

Ideally, the design should include large, open, extendible 
multipurpose areas, which are roughly square, and 
organised horizontally rather than vertically, and an inviting 
entrance. Areas for adult users can have five or six shelf 
levels (maximum reach 1.80m - @)); in the children’s area 
there should be four shelf levels with a reach height of 
around 1.20m. Shelf aisles should not be more than 3m 
long, and can also be used to produce niches and exhibition 
stands. Book transport should be with book trolleys 
920mm x 990mm x500mm (DxHxW). The goods elevator 
should be at the service entrance, and larger libraries 
should also have book conveyors. 

Floor loadings in public libraries should not exceed 
5.0kN/m2, in archive storage and similar open access areas 
with closely spaced stacks they should be 7.5kN/m2 
maximum, and with compact storage (mobile shelving) 12.5 
or 15.0kN/m2.

LIBRARIES 
Science Libraries 


Science libraries have always had a central position in 
science and the life of universities. They are not only 
locations to store books, but also places to work with books. 
Important and decisive contributions to world literature have 
been produced in libraries. The erection of libraries is one of 
the most notable building duties of society. Important 
architectural examples from the 19th century (such as the 
Biblioteca Laurenziana, Florence, and the Bibliotheque 
Nationale, Paris) show how these demands were met. The 
Bereichsbibliothek, Berlin = @, has a gross area of 3800m2 
containing 200000 books in the reading rooms, 300000 
volumes in the open stacks and 8500 journals.

MUSEUMS AND ART GALLERIES 


Museums and art galleries tend to have several of the same concerns, 
and as building types they tend to share many of same features. In 
general, the main concerns of museums and art galleries are 
collecting, documenting, preserving, researching, interpreting and 
exhibiting some form of material evidence. For this purpose, many 
people with varied skills are required. There are, however, important 
distinctions not only between museums and art galleries, but also 
between the different types of museum and art gallery. There are 
institutions such as heritage centres, exploratoria and some cultural 
institutes which are considered to be types of museums. 

To show works of art and objects of cultural and scientific 
interest, the institution should provide protection against damage, 
theft, damp, aridity, sunlight and dust, and also show the works in 
the best light (in both senses of the term). This is normally achieved 
by dividing the collection into (a) objects for study, and (b) objects 
for display. Exhibits should be displayed in a way which allows the 
public to view them without effort. This calls for a variety of carefully 
selected, spacious arrangements, in rooms of a suitable shape and, 
especially in museums, in an interesting and logical sequence. 

As far as possible, each group of pictures in an art gallery should 
have a separate room and each picture a wall to itself, which means 
small rooms. This option also provides more wall space in relation 
to floor area than large rooms, which are nevertheless necessary for 
big pictures. The normal human angle of vision starts 27° up from 
eye level. For a standing viewer, this means that well-lit pictures 
should be hung 10m away with the top not more than 4.90m above 
eye level and the bottom about 70cm below —> 6). The best hanging 
position for smaller pictures is with the point of emphasis (the level 
of the horizon in the picture) at eye level + (). 

It is necessary to allow 3-5m2 hanging surface per picture, 
6-10m? ground surface per sculpture, and 1m2 cabinet space per 
400 coins. 

Calculations for museum and art gallery lighting are highly 
theoretical; the quality of light is decisive. Experiments carried out in 
America can be useful. Recently there has been a steady increase in 
the use of artificial lighting instead of daylight, which constantly 
changes even if north light is used. 

According to experiments carried out in Boston, a favourable 
viewing space is between 30° and 60° up, measured from a point in 
the middle of the floor. This means a sill height of 2.13 m for pictures 
and a viewing range of 3.00-3.65m for sculpture > (0. 

In art galleries there is generally no continuous circular route, 
just separate wings. Both museums and art galleries need side 
rooms for packing, dispatch, administration, a slide section, 
conservation workshops and lecture theatres. Disused castles, 
palaces and monasteries are usually suitable for housing museums. 
They are particularly suitable for historical objects, for which they 
provide a more appropriate setting than some modern museums.

MUSEUMS: EXAMPLES 


Nowadays, many museum buildings are also used as culture 
centres, and this possibility must be included in the planning stage. 
Spaces must be available for permanent and temporary exhibitions, 
libraries, media rooms and lecture theatres. There should also be 
places for relaxation and refreshments, as well as space for 
transport, storage, conservation, workshops and administration. 
Technological innovations are having a big effect not only on 
museum function, but also on the design of exhibits. Two examples 
are the computerisation of collection records and design 
documentation, and lamp miniaturisation and fibre optics and their 


effect on lighting design.

(3) Factors affecting office work 


336 


PRINCIPLES 
Office Work 


The way in which office work is 
organised and roles are defined 
(office structure, customer man- 
agement, office technology) affects 
the requirements for office space. 

Building types develop and 
change over time. In addition to 
innovative prototypes, there are 
types of buildings which are 
representative of the forces and 
influences around when they were 
built — @). The organisation of 
office work increasingly focuses on 
human relationships and comm- 
unications > (1). As office work 
continues to change (from the 
introduction of new technologies), 
a clear understanding of the task 
required becomes a significant 
motivating force. Designers can 
influence all aspects of the working 
environment. Good design is 
extremely important, and has a 
strong influence on job satisfaction. 

The space allocated to a person 
to execute a task is referred to as a 
workstation. This can be a private 
office with full-height partitions 
and a door, an open-plan ‘cubicle’ 
configured from systems furniture 
or low-height partitions, or an 
individual desk in an undivided 
space. 

A large office building will 
consist of several different types of 
space > Q). (1) Office areas will 
have separate offices for one to 
three people with workstations for 
trainees, group offices for up to 20 
people, also with workstations for 
trainees, and open-plan offices for 
up to 200 people on a single level. 
Some offices may combine 
individual workstations with areas 
used by groups. In an open-plan 
office, all spaces are multipurpose 
for individual or team work, except 
for a separate secretarial depart- 
ment. (2) Records areas are for the 
storage of files, drawings, micro- 
film and electronic media, filing 
and recording equipment, doc- 
ument reproduction, play-back and 
shredding. (3) Central clerical 
services areas contain dictating, 
duplicating, printing and photo- 
copying equipment, and personal 
computers. (4) The post room 
handles all incoming and outgoing 
post. (5) Corporate display areas 
contain board rooms” with 
moveable walls, exhibition areas, 
conference rooms and meeting 
rooms. (6) Social facilities should 
include cloakrooms, a kitchen for 
each floor or area, toilets, a rest 
area for employees, refreshment 
rooms, sports facilities and a 
dining room with a kitchen. (7) 
Additional spaces and extensions 
may be needed for training on 
audio-visual equipment. (8) It may 
also be necessary to have an 
entrance drive, parking spaces 
(possibly underground) and 
delivery bays. (9) Circulation 
spaces include corridors, stair- 
ways, lifts, and internal and 
external emergency exits. (10) 
Central services are responsible 
for technical equipment, air 
conditioning, ventilation, heating, 
electric power, the water supply, 
data processing, the computer 
centre, telecommunications, and 
cleaning and maintenance.

Multipurpose terminals are 
replacing individual data-, 
word- and image-processing 
equipment, and_ individual 
systems are being networked 
to form integrated office 
communication systems - (1). 
Video display stations, which 
also require computer 
terminals and _ additional 
equipment, have increased 
the floor area needed in offices by approx. 2-3 m2 to approx. 
15-18 m2. The effects of office automation on workstations and 
layout have created needs which existing office buildings can no 
longer fulfil. These include the greater importance given to the 
quality of the individual workstation, which improves flexibility, 
minimises operating costs, and results in working environments 
that are ecologically acceptable. Reorganisation of space and the 
modernisation of furniture and fittings are just as important as 
new buildings > @). 

Streamlining working procedures can potentially reduce the 
time spent on administrative activities (filing, sorting, copying, 
searching, acquisition of material etc.) and communication 
(conferences and meetings) by approx. 25%. Good design can 
minimise interruptions to the workflow. More telecommuting 
(work at home) compensates for the increased floor area 
requirement described above, but some activities (meetings, 
etc.) must still take place in the office building. There are also 
limits to the usefulness of telecommuting. 

There are other forces which tend to work against potential 
decentralisation, and which may be very important. A 
centralised location may have a prestige advantage, a 
company's presence in a city is a symbol of continuity, and 
employees often prefer a communal working atmosphere and 
shared leisure activities. Video-conferencing, however, could 
reduce job-related travel by approx. 50%.

Changes in the workplace 

Increased efficiency due to information technology and changes 
in work requirements (processes and organisational patterns) are 
changing office structures. Staffing levels are dropping, and 
working groups are getting smaller. The former hierarchical 
division of labour amongst staff, such as manager, secretary, 
senior clerk etc., often develops into an integrated working 
group. This in turn may change floor space allocations. A greater 
awareness of the immediate working environment is closely 
linked to current societal values. These are reflected in attitudes 
toward workplace quality (daylight, use of environmentally 
friendly products, energy conservation) and daily activities 
(ecological aspects, consumption of materials, waste disposal). 
From the employee's viewpoint, the workplace is a vital forum for 
social interaction. This is increasingly important because of the 
stress caused by new technology and formalised work structures. 
Rising levels of physical and psychological stress have resulted in 
greater attention being paid to the work environment. Office 
workers need sufficient space, the freedom to arrange their own 
furniture, good ventilation and lighting, and protection against 
external or unnecessary disruptions. Approximately 65% of the 
working day is spent in limited work areas and 10% in extended 
work areas — (@). Work contacts and shared equipment are 
becoming more important, resulting in the need for individual 
and shared offices and workstations > (3) + ©. 

In addition to reorganisation of existing buildings, new 
concepts for individual and group offices are taking shape, e.g. 
the interconnecting group office partially divided into zones, the 
combined office, or the multiple or multivalent workstation, 
although the latter does not appear to be popular.

PRINCIPLES 


Typology 


Types of office space 

The layout of office space has changed dramatically since the 1950s 
- (). Working methods are always closely linked to available 
technology — (2), and the working structure of earlier years is being 
expanded by modern information technology and office automation. 
As a result, new forms of floor plan are being generated. 

After changing from separate offices in the 1950s, to open-plan 
concepts after the mid-1960s, and group office principles in the 
1970s and 1980s, it seems that a combined office design is 
becoming established in the 1990s. The first examples appeared in 
Denmark in 1976, where new space dividers and combinations of all 
known basic forms were being used. 

The orientation of a new office building will depend on location. 
Where possible, the building should be orientated to admit useful 
daylight while avoiding glare and solar heat gain. In the USA, the 
principal axis of 90% of office buildings runs east-west, since deep 
penetration by morning and evening sun is unpleasant. It is easy to 
use canopies to block the sun from the south. However, if the 
primary axis runs north-south, the sunlight can reach every room. In 
the northern hemisphere, north-facing rooms are justifiable only 
when the building does not have a corridor. 


Systems 

A single row of rooms is generally uneconomical, and is only 
justified for deep office spaces where daylight is a problem —> (3). A 
double row of individual small rooms, all with daylight, was 
previously used in most office buildings —> (4). A three-part 
arrangement is typical of high-rise office buildings > (5). In city 
centres in the USA, designs without corridors evolved. In some, all 
rooms (with either natural or artificial lighting) were grouped around 
a circulation core containing elevators, staircases, ventilation ducts 
etc.; in others, services were located on the periphery > 6). 

Outside the city centre, another US system had a large work 
space in the centre, with sound insulation, ventilation and lighting in 
the ceiling; small offices with daylight were placed around the edge. 
These combined offices were used in Scandinavia after the mid- 
1970s. As in the US system, the floor plan was normally 16-18m 
deep. They were also built as a large open-plan office or as separate 
offices divided into three rows = (7). 

Daylight can usually be used up to a distance of 7.00m from the 
window. New daylight technology systems (see section on daylight) 
which convey and change the direction of the light (prisms and 
reflectors) can make more efficient use of daylight. 

A schedule of accommodation is shown > (8) which compares five 
alternatives in order to obtain quantifiable information about floor 
area requirements. (1) A standard separate office, 1.25m grid module, 
three module spaces only. (2) Deluxe separate office, grid module 
1.50m, various widths. (3) Open-plan office, room depth 20-30m, 
floor area up to 1000m2. (4) Group offices for 15-20 employees, 
workstations no more than 7.50m from the facade. (5) Combined 
office, all single rooms approx. 10m2 with a common area 6-8m deep.

Large office buildings are 
usually multistorey structures 
with moveable internal walls

containing plumbing, staircases, 
elevators etc., are generally 
located at the maximum 
distances specified by the 
building regulations. Service

corridors may be lit directly by 
high-level windows and/or by 
glass doors in the corridor wall. 
Daylight in the corridor may be

that are short — (3), angled — (12,

The area required to connect 
functional spaces in office 
buildings is the circulation area. 
In a closed plan, this is the 
corridors between rooms; in an 
open plan, it is the paths 
through the workstations. Path 
widths need careful consid- 
eration, especially when they 
are part of an escape route. 
Disability access considerations 
include the width of doors and 
circulation routes, wheelchair 
turnaround clearances, and the 
slope and length of ramps, etc.

PRINCIPLES OF TYPOLOGY 
1950s-1960s 


Building concepts | 

The relationships between office organisation and spatial design 
have been classified in a field study in the USA which provided a 
benchmark for changes in office structures as a result of office 
automation. 

Open-plan offices are suitable for large groups of employees 
with a high degree of division of labour, performing routine 
activities with a low level of concentration. Nowadays, open plan is 
more the exception than the rule. The concept was developed in the 
1960s to provide efficiently organised, multipurpose areas, based on 
arguments such as transparency and clarity of working processes, 
and the development of a group spirit. Data processing equipment 
was kept in separate rooms and was not available at each 
workstation. Extremely deep offices (from 20 to 30m) resulted in the 
use of expensive services technology that became unsuitable when 
the building use changed. Modern requirements, such as windows 
which open, lighting and environmental control, and electric power 
suitable for partitioned spaces all limit potential flexibility. 

Sociologists have attested to the implicit coercive nature of 
open-plan offices, which is caused by social control, reliance on 
technical equipment, and visual and acoustic disruptions. This has 
led to a rejection of this type of office by employees. 

Separate offices are suitable for independent work requiring 
concentration, and also for multi-occupant offices for very small 
groups constantly exchanging information. They are still used for 
certain workstation requirements, and in multistorey office buildings 
where the structural form of the building is so dominant that it 
determines the spatial and organisational features of the 
workstations.

PRINCIPLES OF TYPOLOGY 
1970s 


Building concepts Il 
The reversible office was an attempt to improve the open-plan office 
system, which was felt to have many drawbacks for users. These 
included no individual environmental or daylight control, and visual 
and acoustic disturbances. Larger areas were subdivided into separate 
offices, which are better for work requiring great concentration, and 
this began a move toward greater flexibility. In addition, skyrocketing 
energy prices also cast doubt on the desirability of open-plan offices. 
Changes in working structures as a result of new technologies (such 
as personal computers) made it possible to organise work in small 
groups. Group offices (small open-plan offices) are suitable for teams of 
clerical workers who constantly exchange information. They also allow 
greater flexibility for individual decisions about the working 
environment because of their smaller size (max. 7.50m to window) (see 
earlier notes on changes in the workplace). Fully localised 
environmental control is not necessary; back-up control methods can be 
used, in addition to ventilation fins on facades and heating surfaces. 
Methods of reorganisation include remodelling the building, 
providing daylight through courtyards, clear subdivisions in the floor 
plan to create workstations with uniform standards of light, ventilation 
and noise protection, or the use of office equipment that can quickly be 
adapted to fulfil new technical functions that entail more electrical 
cables and complex connections, as well as dividing the space. Raised 
floors and movable partitions often provide an easy way to adapt a 
building in terms of services, communication and space division. An 





example of space reorganisation after employee dissatisfaction is 
provided on the next page (> @6 - @8). Although it is still a popular 
trend, the open-plan office appears to be useful for very few 
Organisational forms or types of work. The prime objectives at 
Bertelsmann were to improve the quality of the workplace while 
retaining the flexibility to adapt to new office technologies and group 
reorganisation, and to use the working space economically and reduce 
operating costs. 


Requirements for group office 


Building concepts III 

Recent trends aim to provide a spatial design that is appropriate for all 
the individual office requirements of an organisation. That means 
providing a space that is flexible when required, allows for group 
work, and includes individual rooms for work requiring concentration.

PRINCIPLES OF TYPOLOGY 
1980s-1990s 


In general, modern office buildings tend to fall into three categories: 
closed plan, open plan, and modified open plan. Selection criteria 
include: 

¢ the amount of planning flexibility required; 

¢ the amount of visual and acoustic privacy required; 

e initial and life-cycle costs. 
Closed-plan offices have full-height walls or partitions dividing the 
space into offices with doors. Private offices are typically located along 
the window wall. Administrative support is housed in workstations 
along corridors or in shared rooms. The advantages include a 
controlled environment, security, visual privacy, physical separation,

CALCULATIONS: BUILDING TECHNOLOGY 


The gross volume of space 
needed and the total construct- 
ion cost mean that fully air- 
conditioned buildings are 1.3-1.5 
times more expensive than non- 
air-conditioned buildings, i.e. 
those which= are naturally 
ventilated » (4). 

A ceiling height of 3.0-3.10m 
is suitable for buildings with little 
service equipment, no suspen- 
ded ceilings and heating pipes on 
an exterior wall. Electric power 
should be supplied through ducts 
in window sills or floors, and the 
power supply for ceiling lights 
through conduits or partitions. 
Corridor areas should also be 
used for ducts and pipes. 

A ceiling height of 3.4m is 
suitable for a building with some 
service equipment, but without 
ventilation equipment. Ducts 
under the floor in corridor areas 
(h = 32cm) should be used for 
heat, electricity and water. 

A ceiling height of 3.70m is 
suitable for office buildings using 
ventilation equipment. A duct 
height of at least 50cm is needed 
for air-conditioned offices, with 
long ducts in the corridor area. 

Open-plan offices need a clear 
ceiling height of only 3.00 m. 
However, the ceiling height 
should be 4.20m if ventilation 
ducts are to be installed. All 
height-related building compo- 
nents affect the cost of the 
building in relation to its usable 
office floor area. 

Air-conditioning systems with 
capillary tube mats use water and 
the principle of localised cooling 
+ @) + ©. The air intake is 
equivalent to the minimum air- 
change rate. Comfortable cooling 
is achieved by radiant protection 
and displacement ventilation 
without turbulence (expanding- 
air ventilation). This creates a 
flow of fresh air (with outlets near 
the floor and at the base of 
furniture), a cushion of warm air 
at the ceiling, and an air-flow 
through the room -; () caused by 
the temperature gradient (main 
surfaces 32°C at the ceiling, 20°C 
at each wall). 

Radiant heating from panels in 
combination with an air intake 
system may be sufficient for 
heating > 6). Such a system uses 
less equipment and thus increases 
the usable floor area. The cost of 
air conditioning with localised 
cooling compares favourably with 
the cost of conventional air 
conditioning. The advantages 
include no draughts, quiet, lower 
investment and operating costs 
(the volume of water that has to be 
conveyed is 1000 times less than 
the volume of air for a closed 
system with the same output and 
heat recovery), a reduction of the 
space required for services (water 
instead of air) and a smaller 
energy plant. Raised floors are 
required to achieve the necessary 
room ventilation and for installing 
services to areas with a large 
amount of equipment. There is an 
increased demand for space for 
services (cables, office auto- 
mation), and a need to guarantee 
flexibility when functional 
processes change - (7) + (). 

The selection of a heating, 
ventilation and air conditioning 
(HVAC) system is usually based 
on performance characteristics, 
system capacity and the avail- 
ability of space to accommodate 
the equipment.

CALCULATIONS: FLOOR AREA 
REQUIREMENTS 


Office area requirements are calculated in two parts. 

(1) People space is calculated as (standard individual space x 
number of people) + allowances for immediate ancillary 
needs + a factor (usually 15%) for primary circulation. 

(2) Non-people space (e.g. machine rooms, and libraries and 
the like for which fittings and equipment sizes are more 
important than staff numbers in setting the area 
requirement) should be calculated by informed estimates 
based on existing good practice or comparable examples 
+ an additional factor for primary circulation. 

Figures for the average floor area requirement for each 

workstation and employee in an organisation (including 

office equipment and space to operate it), not including 
management, have roughly the following distribution: 


30% 3.60-4.60 m2 
55% (average 8.5m2) 7.00-9.00 m2 
15% >9.00-15.00 m2 


The space requirement per employee clearly depends on a 
number of factors, e.g. type of work, use of equipment and 
machinery, degree of privacy, level of visits made by 
outsiders and storage needs. The average workstation floor 
area requirement until 1985 was 8-10 m2; in future it will be 
12-15m2. Although a minimum floor area requirement for 
office workstations has not been defined, the following 
guidelines should be followed: separate offices, minimum 
8-10m2 (according to the grid module); open-plan offices, 
minimum 12-15 m2. 

A representative calculation of the space requirement for 
a workstation is as follows: 

work room, min. 8.00 m2 floor area; 

free circulation space, min. 1.5m2 per employee, but 

min. 1m wide; 

surrounding volume of air, min. 12m3 when most work 

is done while seated, min 15m? when most work is done 

while not seated. 
The following floor-to-ceiling heights are recommended for 
floor areas of: 


up to 50m2 2.50 m 
over 50 m2 2.75 m 
over 100 m2 3.00 m 
over 250 and up to 2000 m2 3.25m 


An American study (Connecticut Life Insurance) indicates 
the following requirements for floor area and space to 
operate office equipment (personal floor area + an 
additional 50cm on all sides): 


office employee 4.50 m2 
secretary 6.70 m2 
departmental manager 9.30 m2 
director 13.40 m2 
assistant vice president 18.50 m2 
vice president 28.00 m2 


The depth of a room depends on the space required for an 
individual in a multi-occupant, open-plan, group or office 
room. The average depth of office space is 4.50-6.00m. 
Daylight illumination reaches work workstations to a depth 
of approx. 4.50m from the window (depending on the 
location of the office building, e.g. in a narrow street or in 
an open area). Rule of thumb: D = 1.5H,,, where D is the 
depth of light penetration and H, is the height of the 
window head (e.g. H, = 3.00m, D = 4.50m). Workstations 
located in the deepest third of the room require artificial 
light. Working groups often have to do without daylight 
penetration, since they may be allocated to deeper rooms if 
that is required by the building layout. 

The width of corridors depends on the occupation of the 
space and the area required to move equipment. Generally 
speaking, it should be possible for two people to pass each 
other.

(1) Minimum room width according to window grid modules 


According to standard dimensions relating to 
the varied space requirements in office 
buildings, the minimum distance between the 
centre lines of windows or window columns is 
1.25m. The resulting distances between the 
centre lines of partitions are 2.50m, 3.75m, 
5.00m etc. > (1) - VW). These offer considerable 
choice in positioning furniture, and are flexible 
enough to fulfil almost every requirement. If a

The largest grid module for office buildings 
is 1.875m; the figure > “) - &) shows some 
examples of the many efficient ways to 
position furniture. Beam spacing according to 
the standard dimensions of 625mm or 1.25m is 
also suitable for this centre distance, and every 
third beam will coincide with a facade column.

1.20 m grid module 

The standard room size of 
18 m2 (3 x 1.20m less 0.10m 
for the partition) corresponds 
to a 3.50m room width, which 
is too narrow for standard 
furnishings for two employ- 
ees (2 x 1.00m clearance plus 
2 x 0.80m depth of desk = 
3.60m). The two-grid-module 
room, 2.30m wide, is too 
narrow for one senior staff 
member with seating for a 
visitor. Deeper workstations 
with video display units and 
other special equipment 
require the next largest room 
(4.70m). 


1.30m grid module 

A room 3.80m wide, corres- 
ponding to 18m2 usable floor 
area, allows for an additional 
filing cabinet, two video 
display stations 0.90m deep, 
one drawing table or drawing 
machine and one desk, and 
one desk and conference table 
for four people. Such an office 
is very flexible, and will 
accommodate workstations of 
all standard office sizes without 
any need to move the walls. 


1.40 grid module 

A room 4.10m wide, i.e. 3 x 
1.40m less 0.10m for a 
partition, provides excellent 
possibilities for furnishing and 
more flexible use. A room 
depth of 4.40m, providing 
18m2 floor area (i.e. 4.10m x 
4.40m), is normally sufficient 
for special uses or greater 
demands on space. Increasing 
the room depth to 4.75m 
increases the usable floor 
area of a three-grid-module 
standard room to 19.5m2 (i.e. 
4.10m x 4.75m).

Many furniture systems in 
contemporary offices are still 
designed according to standards 
in use since 1980. In addition, 
furniture units such as simple 
work tables and desks that 
incorporate filing systems are 
still used. Because of the 
increasing use of VDUs and 
keyboards, European standards 
for workstations specify a 
surface height of 72cm high. A 
new desk measuring 140cm x 
70cm x 74cm > @) has been 
introduced, together with the 
standard desk whose dimen- 
sions are 156cm x 78cm x 
78cm. The requirements include 
adjustable workstation height, 
protection against vibrations, a 
sound-absorbent surface and 
foot rests with ergonomically 
correct height, preferably 
adjustable. 

Chairs should be adjustable, 
with castors and upholstered 
seats and_ backs. Properly 
contoured back support for the 
lumbar curve is essential in an 
office chair. It should also 
provide firm support for the 
lower part of the back and the 
upper thighs. Many combinat- 
ions of typewriter stand and 
desk are available, ranging from 
space-saving units to built-in 
systems.

CALCULATIONS: ARCHIVE SPACE 


In spite of new office technologies, the use of paper as the main storage 
medium for information has increased. Paper consumption doubled 
every 4 years until 1980. Computer memory has now become a more 
common way of storing information in office communication systems, 


195 195 es but the need for what is known as uncoded information (printed letters, 
texts, periodicals etc.) means that paper will continue to be used. 
It is necessary to arrange stored documents in a clearly labelled 
a system, with short circulation routes and efficient use of space. Space 
a should also be available for archives > (1). As cabinet widths increase, 
se is the aisle between cabinets should also get wider.

eZee Ss the relationship between furniture floor area and aisle space required 
(a) Cabinet system, series A (2) Series B > ©) = for a vertical filing system using large archival shelves (Velox system) or 
a flat filing system. The floor area needed for a vertical filing system is 
5.2m?, and the aisle space should be 4.6m2 (100:90). For flat filing 
systems, the floor area is 3.2m? and the aisle space 3.6 m2 (90:100, ratio 
reversed). Flat filing systems cannot hold as much as vertical ones, and 
high shelf units are hard to organise. Vertical files may reduce staffing 
levels in the filing section by 40%. Hanging files use wall space 87% 
better than box files > (5). An efficient way to move files is by 
paternoster elevator. Workstations should include shelves for sorting, a 
small table and a chair on castors. 

The filing room should be centrally located, and the best window grid 
module is between 2.25m and 2.50m. Since a clear height of only 2.10m 
is required, three storeys of filing could be fitted into a space which would 
only take two storeys in normal offices. Dry storage rooms are essential, 
and therefore attics and basements are unsuitable. 

Narrow shelves -» and (7) with hanging files and a writing 
surface can provide a functional connection between workstations. 
Trolleys can be used either as writing surfaces or for card-index boxes. 
Rack for magnetic tapes or Pull-out shelf for microfilm Movable filing systems give substantial space saving (100-120%) by 
film (49 separate holders) cassettes (164 capacity) eliminating intermediate passages — (8B. There are no fixed 
standards for filing systems. They are usually adapted to suit 
individual requirements, such as registries, archives, libraries and 
storage areas. The increase in load for each square metre of floor 
space must be taken into account. File shelving may be moved by 
hand or by mechanical means. In some designs, the entire filing 
system, or only parts of it, can be locked by one handle.

CALCULATIONS: WORKSTATIONS 
WITH COMPUTERS 


Workstations equipped with a computer must 
accommodate at least a visual display unit (VDU) and an 
alphanumeric keyboard. There is no standard for such 
workstations because the requirements vary widely 
depending on individual work processes (e.g. from a simple 
networked terminal for enquiries to stand-alone systems for 
data entry and manipulation, which in addition to the VDU 
and keyboard may also have disk drives, scanners, printers 
and other peripherals). These workstations should be 
designed according to national safety requirements and 
generally accepted technical standards for good practice 
based on an understanding of ergonomics. 


Workstation design 
ltems that are used frequently should be placed within the 
preferred field of vision and reach area > ()- ©). 

The best working position is when the person is seated 
with the upper arm perpendicular to the floor and the 
forearm at a 90° angle. The thighs should be parallel to the 
floor with the lower leg at a 90° angle — @. The table and 
chair must be adjustable to allow proper positioning for 
users of different heights. Two ergonomic systems are 
equally acceptable. 

A: Type 1 workstation 


Adjustable-height table 60-78cm 

Adjustable-height chair 42-54cm 
B: Types 2 and 3 workstations 

Fixed-height table 72cm 

Adjustable-height chair 42-50cm 

Adjustable foot rest 0-15cm 


Sufficient leg clearance should be provided > ©). 

In work areas, all items of equipment close to the user 
(on the desk top, etc.) should have a 20-25% reflection 
factor. Illumination should be between 300 and 500Lx, and 
glare from lights must be limited (e.g. by providing specular 
louvred ceilings above VDU stations). Arrange lighting 
strips parallel to the window. Matt surfaces in the room 
should have the recommended reflection factors (ceiling 
approx. 70%, walls approx. 50%, movable partitions 
approx. 20-50%). 

The worker's line of sight to the monitor should be 
parallel to the windows and to any lighting tubes; the 
monitor should be between these if possible. It is necessary 
to install blinds to control daylight at visual display 
workstations. 

Follow local recommendations for environmental 
contro! and noise protection. The increased use of heat- 
generating electronic equipment in offices tends to result in 
the need for additional cooling to maintain a comfortable 
temperature. 


The impact of information technology 

Employment usually required attendance at a place of work 
because the materials and tools were there, and the work 
needed to be supervised. However, advances in information 
technology mean that the ‘material’ for most office work 
(information) can be transmitted electronically. The tools of 
office work are increasingly a telephone and a workstation, 
both of which can be installed at home. Innovations in 
communication technology are gradually having a major 
impact on how the work environment is defined. It is also 
freeing many workers from geographical constraints. The 
free-address workstation is becoming a technical reality, 
with portable voice and data links to anywhere in the world. 
However, the free-address workstation has implications for 
both people and organisations, such as the need for 
increased social interaction and new management 
techniques which are able to cope with a widespread

The placement of general 
expansion joints depends on 
the type of structure, 
foundations, ground conda- 
itions, etc. They are usually 
between 30 and 60m apart. 

Joints are generally required 

to accommodate movement 

safely. e.g. structural move- 
ment, or thermal expansion 
and contraction. 

e The simplest design 
uses reinforced concrete 
to erect paired columns 
that are covered to 
protect against weather. 

¢ Cantilevered floors and 
expansion joints between 
the two cantilevers are 
subject to the greatest 
stress. 

¢ Complex designs, e.g. 
with connected buildings 
and parapets, usually 
create enormous stresses. 


Wind force on high-rise 
buildings causes areas of high 
or low pressure that can force 
rainwater in through window 


joints or cracks in walls

OFFICE BUILDINGS 
Examples 


High-rise buildings 

The first high-rise buildings were 
office blocks. Lower floors usually 
contained shops and stores with 
sales areas throughout and no atria. 
Office areas were located above, 
and were often set off by a different 
scale and choice of materials. 
Vertical circulation components, 
lifts, stairs and service rooms in a 
central location had only artificial 
ventilation and lighting. New 
possibilities were provided by 
stepped buildings with stairway 
and lift towers situated immediately 
to one side. 

High-rise buildings are intended 
for continuous human occupation, 
and have a floor on the top storey 
on at least one side of the building 
that is more than 22m above 
ground level. Window sills must be 
at a height of at least 0.90m above 
floor level and be fire resistant. 
Window surfaces that cannot safely 
be cleaned from inside the building 
must be cleaned by experts, using 
exterior equipment.  High-rise 
buildings should be divided into 
fire compartments that are 30m 
long and enclosed by fire-resistant 
walls. Escape routes from each 
room on each storey must be 
provided via at least two 
independent staircases. Alternative 
escape routes within limited travel 
distance must be accessible from 
the fire to a protected zone. One 
stairway must have external 
windows on each floor. In high-rise 
buildings, some staircases should 
be constructed as _ fire-fighting 
staircases with smoke. outlets, 
vents and fire-resistant, self-closing 
doors. The effective width of 
stairways and landings depends on 
the function of the building, but 
must be at least 1.25m. Emergency 
stairs must have an effective width 
of at least 0.80m. 

A frame construction of steel or 
reinforced concrete is the standard 
structure for high-rise buildings. The 
need for flexible spaces with large 
spans is making masonry construc- 
tion obsolete. However, the size of 
span depends on material and 
design. A solid reinforced concrete 
floor can have a span of 2.5-5.5m, 
and a ribbed floor 5.0-7.5m, both 
with a maximum 12.5m between 
main beams. The effective span of 
pre-stressed concrete is 25.0m, but 
only with 0.75m._ structural depth. 
The exterior wall should be a curtain 
wall in front of set-back external 
columns. In both steel construction 
and assembly units, steel main and 
secondary beam systems make 
assembly easier but shorten the 
possible spans. A mixed design with 
a steel frame and concrete floors is 
often used.

engineering methods — @). The John Hancock Center, Chicago, 
1965 — (4), was the result of an economical structural approach 
by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. The visible structural 
components were part of the design concept. Use of the pipe 
principle significantly reduced the use of steel. Its efficiency of 
operation is due to its multiple uses: floors 1-5 have shops, floors 
6-12 are parking spaces, floors 13-41 are flexible-use offices, 
floors 42-45 have technical facilities and a sky lobby, floors 46-93 
are residences, floors 94-96 are for visitors and restaurants, and 
floors 97 and 98 house television transmission equipment. 

New York's Department of City Planning has issued a 
brochure that contains examples of how statutory requirements 
attempt to guarantee sufficient daylight and circulation space in 
spite of the increasing volume of construction.

Equitable Building, 120 Broadway, built in 1916 before the first zoning regulation 
The 1916 regulation required a specific ratio of street width to building height. That 
led to the typical ‘wedding cake’ skyscraper 

The plot ratio as a regulatory instrument was introduced in 1961. The initial limit 
was 15 

At the same time more street space was required, resulting in the tower over a 
plaza. The Seagram Building is shown here 

Plazas received a bonus that increased the plot ratio to 18 





(3) (1) - (9) Zoning laws indicate permissible building volumes 


6 The use of plazas would have meant the destruction of avenues in some cases, so 


the system of running public roads through buildings was developed. The plot 
ratio was increased to 21.6 


7 More recent regulations once again deal with daylight, with one alternative 


involving a daylight curve for a plot ratio of 15 


8 Another alternative depends on the dimensions of the unobstructed skyline (plot 


ratio of 18) 


9 The most recent daylight chart may also be used (plot ratio of 18)

Frankfurt am Main, 1990, was the 
outcome of a competition. The offices 
were to be let. Most of the ground floor 
area was kept open, and the plinth floors 
recall the requirements of New York 
City’s zoning laws. A striking effect in the 
urban space was an important criterion 
in appraising the entries to the 
competition. The building has 51

There is a trend towards open-plan layouts in modern 
banks and building societies. This is intended to provide 
more room for the customers, making them feel 
comfortable and welcome. Since bulky protective screens 
are now almost unnecessary, large additional areas can be 
opened up for customer use. 

Over recent years bank design has evolved to 

accommodate the following ideals: 

e A ‘shop-like’ retail environment. 

e Fully glazed or open frontages to create a more 
inviting image. 

° Services that are dealt with as products to be ‘sold’ by 
staff trained to deal with customers in a friendly, 
attractive environment. 

° More space given over to the customer and designs 
with better use of light and colour, prominent 
merchandising and designated sales, comfortable 
waiting areas and private interview rooms. 


Open-plan principles 
The idea of open planning is to bring staff and customers 
much closer together and build up customer loyalty. The 
aim is to generate an environment for improved service and 
with it enhanced business for the bank. Pugh Martin, an 
architect working with Barclays Bank, listed the following 
guiding principles relating to a high street open-plan bank. 
¢ Maximise space given over to customer: move 
service counters as close to perimeter walls as 
possible; reduce space for support staff and 
equipment. 
¢ Minimise space for processes and secure areas (‘back 
office’ functions are increasingly being moved from 
branches and centralised).

BANKS AND BUILDING SOCIETIES 
Open-plan Layout 


¢ Maximise potential for ‘selling’ financial products: by 
re-locating counters and non-sales functions, wall 
and floor space is released for displaying product 
literature and advertising material. This makes it 
possible to deliver coordinated marketing campaigns 
easily seen by the customers. 

¢ Create personal contact space for dealing with 
financial products: allow for specialised, sometimes 
purpose-built, self-contained desks at which trained 
staff can deal face-to-face with customers. 

° Achieve an open, inviting and customer-friendly 
environment that brings the customer in easily, 
makes each service easy to find and enables the 
customer to circulate throughout the bank 
comfortably. 


Cash dispensers 

Cash dispensers (or automatic teller machines, ATMs) are 
now a universal feature of modern high street banks and 
building societies. They can sit inside the bank or face into 
the street, the latter allowing customers access to their 
account details and funds 24 hours per day. 

Cash dispensers are usually built into the bank facade 
and they need to: (1) be at or near ground level to allow for 
easy public access, (2) allow access from the rear to bank 
staff, (3) not disrupt window frames, sills or horizontal 
banding, and (4) correspond to the rhythm and scale of the 
fenestration above. Sometimes, cash dispensers are placed 
at the side of the building, which helps to solve the problems 
of disabled access and of obstruction of the pavement if 
queues form at busy times when the bank is closed. In larger 
banks, a number of cash dispensers can be set in an 
adjoining lobby that is open to customers at all times.

In general, wall safes are metal boxes built into the walls 
and hidden behind wallpaper or a painting. They are used 
to protect valuables in both domestic properties and 
business premises. > ()+(@) 

To store valuable and confidential paperwork securely, 
businesses make use of steel document cabinets — @), many 
of which also contain a safe and are fireproof. Floor safes are 
used for secure storage of petty cash and documents -> @). 
Valuables that are rarely used are best kept in a rented safety 
deposit box in the strongroom of a bank - ©). 

Bank strongrooms should be designed to prevent 
criminals from breaking in forceably. The enclosing 
structure and door must be able to resist penetration for 
sufficient time to thwart potential intruders. Structures 
enclosing strongrooms should, therefore, neither adjoin 
neighbouring spaces (i.e. no party walls) nor be built in 
seldom-used areas of the bank, and must not have earth 
below. Experience has shown that intruders otherwise have 
ample time to work in the unsupervised location and reduce 
the wall to a thin layer that can then be quickly broken 
through. Therefore, if a strongroom is not surrounded on all 
sides, including above and below, by parts of the bank that 
are in constant use, it must be an independent structure that 
is surrounded by a free space allowing full supervision. 

Tests have shown that a 1:3 mix concrete with specific 
mineral additives offers better protection than masonry. A 
proficient mason equipped with sharp chisels would need 
over 12 hours to break through a 40cm thick wall of that 
type, compared with only 9 hours for a hard-fired brick wall 
with 1:3 mortar. Iron reinforcement barely slows down a 
thief (hardened rods can be broken with a hammer and 
normal rods can be cut out) so the added cost is not 
justified. 

The most economical way to enclose a strongroom is by 
50cm of 1:4 concrete, which would require 20 hours to 
break through. Assuming an 8 hour working day, a thief 
would have only 16 hours available. However, in the worst 
case, with a Sunday and two holidays, thieves could have 
88 hours and since modern electric and pneumatic drills are 
increasingly powerful, strongrooms are always vulnerable. 
Therefore, they should be inspected frequently outside of 
official business hours and this can be done using 
electronic listening devices that can notify the watchman’s 
station at the bank, or the closest police station, of the 
slightest noise occurring outside of business hours.

Strongroom doors 

To withstand any attack, strongroom doors are made from 
toughened steel plate with fireproof and non-melting 
reinforcement, and are typically 27-30cm thick. The 
armoured doors pivot smoothly on steel hinges and the 
edges are machined to fit exactly into the reinforced door 
surround. They do not have keyholes, instead using 
elaborate remote-controlled locking devices, and are 
usually protected by electrically operated alarm systems 
that are triggered by the slightest vibration of door.

GLAZED ARCADES 
Typology 


The glazed arcade is a building type which is both interesting 
and popular in contemporary architecture. Arcades may be 
on a single level, slope gently to follow the contours of the 
site, or have a split-level arrangement to change levels. 
Arcades are through routes intended exclusively for 
pedestrians. They should be accessible around the clock as 
semi-public routes. Arcades can have a multiplicity of uses 
(retail sales, mixed sectors, etc.). Therefore facilities that will 
attract customers outside normal business hours should be 
encouraged. Glass structures are supported by steel, 
aluminium or laminated wood beams.

Passage du Caire + @),@) is the oldest surviving glazed 
arcade in the world, and at 370m is the longest in Paris. This 
low-key, two-storey arcade is on average only 2.70m wide. It 
houses two storeys of shops, as well as apartments above 
the glass roof. Galerie Vivienne — @),@), by architect Francois 
Jacques Delannoy (1755-1835), was built at nearly the same 
time as Galerie Colbert, which is located in the same block 
of buildings. Passage du Grand Cerf — @),40 is only 4m wide, 
but is three storeys high and 120m long. It runs straight 
through a block of buildings. There are shops on the ground 
floor, offices and workshops on the first floor, and 
apartments on the second floor. More than most other 
arcades in Paris, the 190m long Passage Choiseul -> @ is a 
roofed-over street. There is separate access to each building 
by a spiral staircase. Passages Joufroy and Verdeau > 6) is 
a combined, roofed pedestrian system which is 400m long. 
Galleria Mazzini - @+@®) is one of the monumental arcades. 
Leeds Thornton’s Arcade - 4 has houses in front and an 
arcade area occupying three storeys. Galleria Umberto | 
+3, is an ideal embodiment of a cross-shaped design 
with four entrances. The crossing is crowned with a giant 
dome. Morgan Arcade 45,46 was built in 1897 by the 
architect Edwin Seward for David Morgan. It was altered by 
the later addition of department store buildings on the 
Hayes.

GLAZED ARCADES 
Historic Examples 


Galleria Vittorio Emanuele Il in Milan represents the 
developmental zenith of arcade architecture. It is the 
culmination of a process that began with the ‘passages’ in 
Paris and reached an intermediate stage with the Galeries 
St. Hubert in Brussels. The plan of the Galleria is in the 
shape of a Latin cross with its centre expanded into an 
octagon. The main dimensions are: longitudinal arm 
196.62m; diameter of octagon 36.60m; height to top of 
lantern 47.08m - @) + @), and © + @. Those dimensions are 
exceeded only in some details of later arcades, e.g. the 
height of the Galleria Umberto | in Naples, and the length of 
the GUM department store in Moscow = @). Significant 
references to the urban facades of Palladio can be seen in 
the design of its interior. 

The GUM department store building in Moscow 
+ @3)+@ and @)+@) is in approximately the shape of a 
parallelogram, with sides measuring 90mx250m on 
average. The polygonal extension in the centre of the 
intersecting central aisles is reminiscent of the arcade in 
Milan, although the tranverse arm does not extend up to the 
roof. 

Galeries St. Hubert — 47+ (3 is the first example of a 
monumental arcade. Its volume has rarely been exceeded 
by later examples. The Galeries St. Hubert were also the 
first to be publicly funded.

GLAZED ARCADES 
Applied Examples 


Galleries and arcades are design elements that have been 
re-discovered by architects. Their transparent roofs span 
roads, paths and squares, and connect buildings, shops and 
stores. Galleries and arcades have been used to expand 
pedestrian zones, protect against bad weather, and provide 
a meeting place. 

A shopping arcade in Hamburg -» (1) - @) has a site area 
of 11000 m2. There is shopping space of 9400 m2 over three 
levels, and roof parking for 180 cars. 

Kaiserpassage in Bonn - @)-@)is based on 19th century 
arcades and galleries. Bringing together specialised shops,

SHOPS 


The walls, floors, counter tops and work surfaces in 
fishmongers, game and poultry shops and butchers must 
be washable. Suitable materials therefore include marble, 
ceramic tiles, glass and plastics. 

Fish perishes quickly and so must be kept chilled. It also 
smells strongly so fishmongers’ shops should be 
surrounded by air-locks or air-curtains. Note that smoked 
fish, unlike fresh fish, must be stored in dry conditions and 
provision must be made for this. The possibility of large bulk 
deliveries should be taken into consideration. There may 
also be a need for an aquarium to attract the eye. > @)+@ 

Game and poultry shops are sometimes part of fish shops 
and often stock only one day's supply of goods. They require 
a separate work room with facilities for plucking and 
scraping. As poultry absorbs smells, it must be stored 
separately both in the cold room and shop. Large refrigerated 
compartments and display cases are needed. > @)+@ 

Butchers’ shops > 40 + (7) should preferably be on one 
level and have trucks on rails or castors to allow carcasses 
(which can weigh up to 200kg) to be moved easily. Work 
rooms and cold rooms should be one and a half to two 
times the size of the shop. 

All fittings in cold stores must be adequately protected 
against corrosion, due to the high humidity level in these 
spaces. 

The conflict in fishmongers’ and butchers’ shops between 
balancing the requirements of temperature for staff comfort 
(around 16°C) and the display of provisions (-2°C to 0°C), can 
be dealt with by using directional fan heaters, which blow 
warm air towards staff and away from food, radiant heaters 
placed high on the walls or under-floor heating. 

In addition, adequate ventilation is required for the 
removal of smells. 

Fruit and vegetables need to be kept cool but not 
refrigerated. Potatoes should be kept in dark rooms. Sales 
are mostly from delivery containers (baskets, crates, boxes 
etc.) and dirt traps and refuse collectors should provided 
below storage racks. > (7) + @) 

In general, the planning and design of greengrocers’ 
shops should consider the requirements for delivery and 
unpacking of goods, washing, preparing, weighing, 
wrapping, waste collection and disposal. Flower shops can 
be combined with fruit and vegetable shops.

DEPARTMENT STORES AND 
SUPERMARKETS 


The department store is essentially a very large shop, 
generally on several floors, selling a wide variety of goods, 
including clothes, household goods and food. Their design 
should provide maximum flexibility to permit frequent 
adjustments required for the seasonal sales patterns. The 
food department is the only one purpose designed. A main 
structural grid between 5.4 and 6m is commonly used, with 
5.4m being considered optimum. 

The increasing requirement for car-parking space has led 
to the growth of purpose-built out-of-town shopping centres. 
These in turn have encouraged the development of huge DIY 
warehouses, discount markets and ‘hypermarkets’, which are 
modelled along supermarket lines. 

The largest hypermarkets are about 250000m2. 
Shoppers generally purchase a greater quantity of goods in 
hypermarkets than in supermarkets and therefore larger 
size trolleys are used. This needs to be considered in the 
design. The ‘superstore’ is a further development of the 
hypermarket.

WORKSHOPS: WOODWORKING 


Generally the change in plan form from long sheds to more 
compact developments — (@)-(@) improves economy: the 
site is more efficiently used; routes are shorter in mixed 
production; service ducts are shorter. Multistorey buildings 
are not appropriate for production areas but are 
recommended for offices, ancillary rooms and store rooms 
for small and/or valuable articles. Predominant building 
types have steel frames with reinforced concrete and metal 
or timber cladding. Walls and roofs of large manufacturing 
units should have good heat and sound insulation. Windows 
of insulating glass are mostly fixed; natural lighting from 
above is possible; a smaller proportion of window area as 
required by regulations should serve for ventilation and view. 

Space requirements (for examples shown): an average of 
70-80 m2per employee (without open storerooms). 

An extractor system is required in virtually all cases to 
remove wood chippings, sawdust and wheel dust, both for 
the sake of regulations on health and safety at work and on 
economic grounds. The arrangement of machines is 
determined according to the sequences of operations. 
Rubber bonding to metal mountings can reduce high levels 
of machine noise. 

In small companies with up to ten employees, general 
production flow can be in a line or L-shaped. In medium-sized 
companies with more than ten employees, a U-shaped or 
circular (or square) arrangement gives a better flow. In the 
latter case functions are combined: gate, load and unload, 
ramp, supervision, checking, goods in, dispatch. 

Work sequence: timber store, cutting area, drying room, 
machine room, bench workshop, surface treatment, store, 
packing. Machine room and bench workshop is divided by a 
wall with doors > @). Office and foreman’s room are glazed, 
with view of workshop. Workshop floor: wood, wood-block 
or composition flooring. All workstations should face the 
light. Continuous strip windows, high sills (1.00—1.35m).

Enclosed shelving space 
V=bxhxIl=1.0 x 2.0 x 6.0 = 12.0m3 
If the density of material, r, is 0.8t/m%, the total weight 
stored would be 
R=Vxr=12.0x 0.8 = 10t (rounded up) 
If the number of employees working in production is 8, and 
each uses 7.5t per year, the annual materials requirement is 
B=8x7.5 = 60t 
The store turnover frequency is then given by 
B=+R-=60+10=6times 
However, there is always lost space (space taken up by 
shelving itself, handling space, non-optimal storage) so a 
rack can never be fully (100%) used.

VEHICLE REPAIR SHOPS 


It is not possible to use a fixed scheme when planning and 
building car-body repair shops, as local conditions usually 
vary considerably. Instead, it is necessary to use a planning 
method which is based on service and working procedures 
and which takes company-specific features and needs into 
account. 

On completion of the first building phase the operation 
should be fully functional. Thereafter, it should be possible 
to enlarge the company at any time. 

In a car-body repair shop the workstations are virtually 
all fixed and equipped with different tools. They should be 
designed in such a way that tasks can be carried out 
economically and in the shortest possible time, with 
minimum movement. 

For companies involved in vehicle repair it is useful to 
structure the workshop on a ‘performance production 
principle’. Vehicles are driven into the workshop and remain 
at the designated repair bay until the work is finished. 

Example > (7) shows a plan of a bodyshop for repairing 
and servicing cars and small trucks, employing about 14 
people in the workshop and two in the offices. All functional 
areas where repair work is done are on one level and kept 
apart from the customer area by separate entrances. 

To avoid noise and dust pollution the paint- and 
bodyshops should be separate. Due to the different sizes of 
vehicles to be repaired and the different kinds of repair work 
there is only a limited possibility of making fixed plans for 
workstations and machine positions. 

The dimensions of the workstations should therefore be 
such that even when the repair shop is fully occupied, 
mobile work benches or the required tools can be moved to 
the vehicle. Lay service ducts overhead. 

In paintshops use the following standard dimensions for 
spray booths (clear dimensions): length 7.00m, width 4.00m, 
height 2.85m. Design: construction in insulated sheet metal 
or brickwork or self-contained system for use outdoors. 

Customer reception area should be on the ground floor; 
accounts, manager's office, social rooms etc. can be on 
upper floors.

1st building phase 

















VEHICLE COMPANY WORKSHOPS 


Design of premises: after space requirement has been 
established and a site chosen, planning the building can 
begin. The characteristics of the site, such as size, shape, 
vehicle access, road design etc., must be taken into 
consideration. 

Planning example > @) Planning permits an efficient 
functioning design of all required spaces and facilities. The 
repair shop is designed to accommodate four 6.50m x 3.50m 
workstations, and equipped with a four-column car lifting 
frame and wheel balancing equipment; nearby spare parts 
store. 

Planning example — (3) First construction phase includes 
three work bays in the repair shop and a car wash. The 
finished scheme has an extra five workstations in the repair 
shop and a showroom. 

In a company working with commercial vehicles the 
choice of position for the gates depends primarily on the 
shape of the site. From both the fitters’ and customers’ 
points of view, the best design is one where entry to and 
exit from the repair bays are through separate gates, 
particularly for work on articulated vehicles. 

Ideally, the site depth or width should be = 80m but repair 
shops for light commercial vehicles are possible on sites 
with little depth (minimum 40m). -» @- © for a company 
working with light commercial vehicles and buses.

WORKSHOPS: BAKERY 


Systematic planning must anticipate possible future 
developments in technology and operating procedures to 
which building elements will have to adapt. The planning 
procedure must also always include a review of the 
location. 


Schedule of accommodation and space requirements 
There is a basic division into store areas, production areas, 
sales areas, building services areas, offices for 
administration and management, social rooms and 
ancillary rooms. > @) 

Work processes in or between the individual areas -> (2) 

Distinction should be made between store rooms for raw 
materials (coarse meal, sugar, salt, baking powder, dry 
goods in sacks, flour in silos or sacks), ingredients (fruit, 
garnishings, dried fruit, fats, eggs) and packaging. Daily 
supplies are stored at the workstations. Establish space 
requirement for containers (shelving, racks, Cupboards), 
stacks, counters and circulation (corridors). Minimum area 
for stores is 15m2; roughly 8-10m? per employee for all 
store rooms. Routes between stores and work areas should 
be short. 

Work areas for bakery and pastry should be separate. 
The bakery needs a warm and humid environment; pastry 
making needs a rather cooler environment. The bakery 
includes the following areas: dough preparation, working of 
dough, baking, storage of finished products. Pastry making 
is split: cold area (butter cream, cream, chocolate, fruit) and 
warm area (pastes, cake, pastries and biscuits). 

The space requirement can be determined using a layout 
plan. In a work area space is needed for equipment, for 
handling and working, for intermediate storage (trolleys) 
and counters, and for circulation (lost space).

WORKSHOPS 


Butcher's shop — (1) 

Model plan; 6-7 employees 

Functional sequence within a sausage making company. 
Meat arrives in machine room for cutting and mincing, is 
taken into the smoking chamber and then into the boiler 
(kitchen). From there it is sent to the cooling area or shop. 

Height of working areas (depending on size of company) 
2 4.0m. Width of circulation routes > 2.0m. Work space 
around cutter and mincer: 3m2 each. 

Distance of machines from walls (for repairs) 40-50cm. 
Cooling machines which work day and night must have 
good sound insulation. Water supply with hose connection 
should be provided in the kitchen, machine room and 
salting room. Floors should be non-slip and waterproof, 
preferably with corrugated tiles and drains. Walls should be 
tiled high. Good general lighting is needed, with 300Ix at 
workstations. Provide staff room, lockers, WC and shower 
for employees. Comply with relevant regulations on health 
and safety in the workplace, building regulations and 
accident insurance. 


Ladies' and gentlemen's tailor — @) 
Model layout for 10 employees 


Electrical repair shop — > @) 

Work spaces should have a clear height of > 3m with 15m3 
air volume per employee. To minimise the risk of 
electrocution in the workshop, faultless insulating floor 
coverings should ideally be provided; at the very least the 
work benches for the technicians should be insulated. 
Recommended lighting level is 500Ix; 1500Ix for very fine 
assembly work. 

Work benches must have a spacious worktop (1.0m x 
2.0m if possible). Provide two under-desk units with 
shallow drawers for circuit diagrams, documentation and 
tools.

WHOLESALE BUTCHERS 


Animals in abattoirs need to be provided with modern pens 
where they can be fed, watered and kept calm because this 
influences the quality of the meat, as does humane, 
painless anaesthetisation and slaughtering. This also allows 
a more complete draining of the blood and in turn ensures 
that the meat looks attractive and can be preserved for 
longer. 

Following the BSE crisis many new practices have 
become compulsory so it is essential to consult the relevant 
guidelines at the start of the planning process. 

The examples shown in @)- ©) are constructed on a grid 
of 15.50 x 15.50m. This evolved from the positioning of 
shelving in the central food store and allows for the width 
needed for fork-lift trucks (> p. 392). Pallets are stacked in 
fives in racks, the two lower shelves containing pallets 
ready for dispatch, the top three shelves containing stocks. 

This uniform grid is also used for other parts of the 
building such as the butchers’ workshop (2 x 3 grid panels) 
and the offices. Extensions can be made using the same 
grid. 

The butcher receives half-carcasses of pigs and cattle 
from the abattoir and processes them into ready-to-sell 
portions or cooked meat products and sausages. A deep 
freeze room is needed for imported poultry and a separate 
cold room for butter and margarine. A waste incinerator can 
be used alongside the oil heating system to heat the 
building, and in summer to air-condition the offices and run 
small cooling plants. 

The required minimum height for processing is 3m_ > (3). 
The slaughter area for large animals, which includes a 
winch, should be 1.50m higher. The windows should be 
high enough to prevent children from looking in and walls 
should be tiled to a height of >2m.

INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS: PLANNING 


(1) Siting 
Location factors: 

e raw materials 

¢ markets 

e workforce 
The order of priority of these factors when selecting a 
location depends on the individual company’s strategy in 
relation to the cost of raw materials, transport costs and 
labour costs. 


(2) Site 
Needs relating to site area are determined by the space 
required by the building, roads and rail track. 

A rail track plan should be drawn up, since railway lines 
take up a lot of space due to wide turning circles. > 1) 

Suitable sites are those with railway lines running into 
the site diagonally. Otherwise the building can if necessary 
be positioned at an oblique angle. 

In case of frequent rail traffic branch lines through site 
should be provided, which would allow a continuous flow. 
= @) 

Sidings ending at the front of the shed are often 
sufficient for goods loaded by crane. 


(3) Schedule of accommodation 
The schedule of accommodation includes details about: 
type of use 
room sizes in square metres 
® room sizes in clear dimensions 
number of employees, segregated according to 
gender (sanitary facilities) 

e machine layout plan 

© live (rolling, working) loads, single or point loads 
Special requirements and other specifications include: 

® noise and vibration countermeasures 
protection from fire, toxic and explosive substances 
energy mains supplies 
air conditioning 
escape routes 
intended or possible extension 


(4) Operational planning 

Careful operational planning is essential before work on 
planning the building begins. Process flows are depicted 
according to the type of production and estimated on the 
basis of annual production figures or number of 
employees. 

lf no empirical data are available, the works engineer will 
have to determine the usable space requirement on the 
basis of the machine layout plan and other company 
operating facilities. 

The basis for the operational planning is taken from 
analysis of the foilowing: 

® operational diagram (of the production systems) 

e materials flow diagram (essential criteria for 
evaluating economic efficiency and important basis 
for layout plan) 
machine location plan 
workforce plan 
schedule of accommodation 
list of buildings 
Layout planning (i.e. allocation of employees, materials and 
machines designed to bring about the lowest production 
costs per unit) is the starting point for all industrial 
planning. From this, the basis for the factory design IS 
derived - adaptability, extension possibilities, economic 
efficiency. 

Note: the techniques of network planning and other 
methods are appropriate —> (8)

HIGH-BAY WAREHOUSES 


High-bay warehouses are changing modern warehousing 
techniques through the use of efficient stacking equipment or 
automatic computer-controlled systems. Handling equipment 
includes fork-lifts — @2, rack trucks, rack stacking equipment 
~+ 04 and stacker cranes > (3) which usually run in the storage 
area without an operator or supervision. 

Many manufacturers of stackers or fork-lifts supply tailor- 
made systems to improve storage capacity and speed of 
dispatch. 

Distributing warehouses throughout the field shortens 
transportation distances and allows rapid response to 
customer demand. Items can be picked and dispatched even 
on a daily basis.

WAREHOUSING TECHNOLOGY 


Safety regulations 


The choice of a high-bay store requires considerations 
about structure, assembly and internal work procedures. 
Material handling equipment and methods must concord 
with existing safety codes and regulations. Racks over 12m 
high are subject to special approval procedures. 


Fire precautions The building inspectorate imposes the 
following conditions for warehouses and other storage 
areas: 
e Escape routes and exits must lead outside or to a 
protected stairwell, with a maximum length of 35m 
¢ Fire walls or compartments should be in place every 
2000-3000 m2 
e Extinguisher systems as well as smoke and heat 
vents must be provided 
e Automatic sprinklers are required for combustible 
materials stored in high bays 
e The structure itself must be fire resistant for an 
adequate length of time 


Security Security of storage areas will be a problem if the 
layout is not specifically designed to secure the contents. 
Consider: 
¢ Doors barred with heavy duty locks 
¢ Constant casual observation, including security 
patrolling at night 
¢ Good fencing around the site, with permanent 
lighting of the area between fence and building

WAREHOUSING TECHNOLOGY 


Rack systems 


The traditional storage system used in industrial buildings 
is shelving, either the screws and brackets type or the plug- 
in shelf system with prefabricated frames into which the 
steel shelves are slotted (the advantage of which is that it 
offers shorter assembly times). The latter type of shelving 
comes in different versions, in sheet metal, with or without 
perforations or wire netting. 

Prefabricated systems are appropriate up to heights of 
about 4.5m and for loads of up to 250kg/shelf. For greater 
loads or heights, pallet racking is more suitable. Beams of 
IPE profiles with welded-in clips are hung in the 
prefabricated frames made of U-profiles into which grooves 
have been punched. Diagonal steel strips give vertical 
bracing. Racking systems at centres of 2.20m have become 
standard (large enough to take three Euro pallets next to 
each other). They can be stacked to a height of 12.00m. 
Intermediate platforms can be constructed for multistorey, 
self-supporting platforms with load bearing capacities of up 
to 500kg/m2. 

Special types of racking such as barrel racks (2000kg 
load per shelf), coil racks (coil weight per axis approx 
1000 kg), comb racks, peg racks, tyre racks, wide-span racks 
and sliding racks are also available.

Shed designs satisfy the 
requirement for economy, 
standardisation, and the need 
for flexible non-specific or 
dumb space. 

Advantages of single- 
storey: low building costs; 
even daylight; high floor 
loads possible; can be built 
on difficult sites; lower 
accident risk. Disadvantages: 
high heat loss (sky lights); 
high maintenance costs; large 
land requirement. 

Wooden structures are 
suitable for lightweight 
buildings, and particularly for 
roofing in large buildings 
using modern truss systems 
with timber connectors. 
Construction using laminated 
timber beams is also a 
possibility. > () 

Steel structures are 
appropriate for industrial 
buildings because modifica- 
tions or additions are easy to 
carry out in steel. Maintenance 
costs (painting) are higher than 
for masonry or concrete. 

Reinforced concrete struc- 
tures: constructed by casting 
in situ. or using pre-cast 
elements; more resistant to 
chemical attack than steel and 
therefore necessary for 
certain industrial buildings. 
Normal (unstressed) reinforce- 
ment for small spans (heavy 
sections); for larger spans 
usually pre-stressed (often 
pre-cast elements). — (13) — (15) 
Dimensions: for lightweight 
buildings bay widths. of 
5-7.5m; economically efficient 
for spans of 10-30m. In cases 
where columns are a hindrance, 
spans of up to 50m are 
possible. > Q) - 42 

If possible, strutting which 
takes up space should be 
avoided and solid frames 
used instead >(1)-(©) with 
tension members in the floor. 
When calculating the distance 
between columns take into 
account the arrangement of 
machines and access routes 
and turning circles of vehicles. 

The shed height may have 
to be adapted to size of 
cranes. Usually no advantage 
in terms of ventilation with 
higher sheds; more important 
iS an appropriate number of 
air changes, facilitated by 
ventilation elements (win- 
dows, ventilation hoods, air 
heaters) which are of the 
correct size and _ properly 
placed.

Siting 

Depends on urban- planning and_ operational 
inter-building distance for considerations. If fenestration on one side only, building 
optimal daylighting should face north-east; if, as is the norm, windows are on

\00_wf se 100 workstation; 75m in the case of work at conveyor belts. In 
changing RLY A large companies it is useful to divide them into smaller 

mee units (e.g. on each floor next to the stairs on the landing). In 

; companies with more than five employees separate toilets 
Weer es must be provided for men and women, as well as toilets for 


the exclusive use of employees where necessary. A lobby is 
not required if there is only one WC per toilet facility and no 
direct access to a work place or area used for breaks, for 
changing, washing or first aid. Toilet cubicles must be 
lockable. If ventilation is through windows on one side only, 
an area of 1700cm? is required, or possibly 1000cm2 if 
space is restricted. 

In toilet facilities for <250 men or <160 women a 
drainage point with smell seal and tap connection with stop 
cock and hose union must be provided, and a sink for 
cleaning purposes. Flooring should be non-slip, water- 
resistant and easy to clean. Walls should be washable to 
22m high. Room temperature 21°C. Well-ventilated lobbies 
are required in front of toilet facilities and should have one

WASHING FACILITIES 


‘Washing facilities’ include all amenities and rooms which 
are used by staff for maintaining personal hygiene. They 
are divided into washrooms, shower rooms and bathrooms. 

They should have a hot and cold water or mixed water 
supply. Each facility should have at least one drainage point 
with stop cock and hose union. During use the facilities 
should have adequate artificial ventilation. 

The number of washing facilities depends on type of 
company. For 100 users: doing clean work, 15; doing 
moderately dirty work, 20; doing very dirty work, 25; doing 
hot, wet, dusty, smelly work, or handling toxic or germ- 
Carrying substances, in sterile and pharmaceutical 
processes or the food industry, 25. 

Depending on the type of company, the facilities should 
be divided into washing and showering facilities. Also 
depending on the type of company, drinking fountains 
should be provided close to work places. > (1) 

The temperature in changing and washing facilities 
should be 20-22°C. Water consumption per person per day 
is roughly 50 litres.

POWER STATIONS 


Power station with fluidised bed firing 
The function of a power station is to generate electrical current, 
steam or hot water in a safe and environmentally acceptable manner. 
In coal-fired power stations, fluidised bed firing became popular in 
the 1980s as an alternative to other means of firing, such as coal dust 
firing or grate firing. Various concepts and practical designs were 
developed: from stationary through to circulatory systems. Due to 
the increasing emphasis on protection of the environment, the trend 
is towards circulatory fluidised bed firing. Further developments are 
anticipated in the direction of pressurised fluidised bed firing. 
The essential system components and the most important 
process flows. -» (1) 
® Steam generation is a very significant part of the installation, 
consisting of the boiler house, with a number of boilers, the 
coal bunkers and small storage containers, auxiliary systems, 
electrostatic filters, induced draught plant and chimney stacks. 

¢ There is a second complex for current generation, which 
contains the turbine house with turbines and steam 
distribution, switch gear with transformers, current 
distribution, electrical measuring, control and 
instrumentation equipment. 

e The monitoring and control of all systems is carried out from 

a centralised control room. 
The essential material flows are: 

© inputs of coal, oil or gas, lime, sand and condensate 

© output flows of electrical current, process steam, ash and flue 

gases 

® internal flows such as cooling water. 

The processing and storage of the solid and fluid substances take 
place centrally in the ancillary systems; the individual user 
equipment within the power station is supplied from this source. 

The kind of application shown in the functional diagram of a 
power station with fluidised bed firing and heat/power coupling » (4) 
occurs in industry and heat generating stations. 

The coal fuel is supplied by a mechanical conveyor to the hot 
ashes in the return ash circuit; it passes from there to the lower 
section of the furnace. In the case of dried types of coal, pneumatic 
conveyance direct into the furnace is preferred. Complete 
combustion takes place at 800-900°C. The air required for 
combustion Is extracted from the boiler house or from the fresh air 
outside, warmed by an air pre-heater and fed via a pressurising 
blower through the base of the tuyere as primary air, and also on a 
number of levels, as secondary air. Hot flue gases arise during the 
combustion. The ash in the furnace, absorbing a portion of the heat 
of combustion due to intensive turbulence, is entrained by the flue 
gases and imparts heat to the heating surfaces in the furnace up to 
the point of entry into the cyclone. 

The solid matter is mostly separated from the mixture of flue 
gas/solids in the cyclone and returns to the furnace via the ash 
return circuit — hence, a circulation of solid matter is achieved. The 
hot flue gases are cooled on the ancillary heating surfaces; 
depending on the temperature level, high pressure steam and 
medium pressure steam becomes superheated, then becomes a 
condensate, and combustion air is heated. The flue gases are 
cleaned at approximately 140°C in the electrofilter - or alternatively, 
in the gauze filter -and drawn off by the induced draught plant via 
either a single chimney stack or a collector chimney stack. 

To maintain the sulphur emissions at an acceptable level, lime is 
fed into the furnace in metered quantities; sand and other materials 
are used on the first filling and, subsequently, provide a build-up of 
the circulating solid matter. 

The generated high pressure steam is used to drive a steam 
turbine, and, then, following intermediate superheating as medium 
pressure steam, expanded to a condition suitable for process steam. 
The energy in the flow is converted to power in the turbine and thence 
to electrical current in the generator. The process steam is used, 
among other things, for the generation of hot water for remote heating 
systems, for drying processes and for chemical reactions. This steam 
gives up heat essentially through condensation and the condensate is 
collected, cleaned if necessary and returned to the boiler as feed water. 

A cross-section - (3) and the plan of a power station » () give 
the dimensions of the salient parts. The dimensions apply to a 
medium industrial power station consisting of three boilers, each 
generating 200t/h of steam. An extension is shown with an 
additional boiler. 

Stage-by-stage extension is possible by integrating new systems in 
existing power station complexes; new designs must also incorporate 
the facility for extension while existing systems are operated 
continuously and must reserve space for such developments.

HYDRO-ELECTRIC POWER STATIONS 


The construction, shape and size of power stations in hydro-electric 
installations depend on the natural conditions and the type, housing 
shape, axial position and number of fluid power machines: the 
smaller the machine, the smaller the built elements. 

Types of turbine are distinguished by their rotational speed. 
The different categories overlap with one another. 


Applications 


large heads (up to 1820m), low 
mass flows; multi-nozzled at high 
mass flows 


Francis turbine medium heads (670—50m) at high 
mass flows 

Kaplan turbine strongly fluctuating mass flows 
and low heads (max. 70m) 


through flow (Ossberger) T | for power up to a max. 800kW 
with strongly fluctuating heads 
and mass flows 






Turbine types 





free jet (Pelton)-turbine 























The pumps in pump-fed reservoir power stations, which store 
excess Current as hydraulic energy, are centrifugal pumps of the 
Francis type. They may, however, be multi-staged when used to 
overcome greater supply heads. Pump turbines are reversible 
machines for pump and turbine operation. 

In Francis and Kaplan turbines, as a rule, the water is fed to the 
turbine through a spiral housing, but at low powers and low- 
pressure heads the turbine assembly can be supplied from a duct. 
For Kaplan turbines of low to medium power, the ducted turbine 
has emerged, in which the ship’s propeller type turbine wheel is 
installed in a tube. On free flow turbines, the housing acts as a 
spray protection for the water that has passed through the 
turbine. The axial direction of the machines can be vertical, 
horizontal, or even inclined, in the case of ducted turbines. 

The output power is distributed by optimising the number of 
machines, each of which is of the same rating. Each set of 
machines is installed as a block, the 3D dimensions of which are 
directly dependent on the type and diameter of the turbine wheel. 
Correct vertical positioning of the turbines is crucial to construction 
costs and trouble-free operation; it is dependent on the type of 
turbine and on the height of the location relative to sea level. 

The complete power station comprises the machine 
assemblies, the foundation blocks, which in plan view occupy 
about the same area, and the ancillary system housings, which 
are grouped around the main assemblies with the minimum 
demands on construction costs and space. 


Methods of construction 

With the exception of underground installations, the size and 
shape of the space occupied by the machines follows two trends: 
halls with gantry cranes, designed for the movement of the 
largest machine components (standard power station 
construction) or, alternatively, open air, low-lying construction, in 
which the largest machine components are lifted by means of an 
external mobile portal crane (or conventional mobile crane). Low- 
lying machine installations, which occur in high-pressure and 
pump storage power stations, are constructed in trench 
excavations with infill (horizontal machines), or using shaft 
construction (vertical machines). In underground installations, 
the turbine machinery is sited in mining industry type cavities, 
wherever possible in solid rock which requires little use of 
constructional concrete.

Small stalls for use by 
hobbyists and smallholders 
require careful arrangement 
and construction if animals are 
to be kept successfully. 
They should be well 
ventilated but draught-free, dry, 
thermally insulated and easy to 
clean. Wooden construction 
with thermal insulation layers is 
preferred and the window area 
should be no more than 10% of 
the stall floor area. Discharge 
facilities must be provided for 
removing droppings. Adjacent 
rooms are needed for feed 
preparation and storage. 

The design must consider 
the position of the sun: 
windows to the south, door to 
the east, laying nests in the 
darkest place. The stall is 
divided into a scratching area 
with a covering of straw and a 
droppings pit with perches 
fitted above — (10) + (17. Ideally, 
the outside run will be of an 
unlimited size but the essentials 
are a grassy surface with a tree 
for shade, a compost heap and 
a sandbath. 

With an unlimited size of 
run, five birds may be kept per 
m2 of stall area; two birds if the 
run is smaller than four times 
the stall area. Places for 
perches, droppings pit, feed 
and drink containers are 
included in the surface areas.

Rabbit hutches .(@)+(4) are 
usually free-standing and 
are positioned against the 
back of stalls or buildings 
so as to be sheltered from 
the wind. They must be 
protected against the 
weather, as well as rats and 
mice, and should be easy to 
clean, with good _ urine 
drainage — @). They must 
also be well ventilated 
because rabbits are sens- 
itive to poor air conditions, 
more so than pigs and 
chickens, for instance. 
Thermally insulated 
hutches with forced-air 
ventilation are ideal for 
breeding and fattening. The 
temperature in the breeding 
hutch should be between 10 
and 28°C, with an optimum 
of 18°C. In the fattening 
hutch, 20°C is desirable. 
Goat sheds should be 
east or south facing. They 
need to be dry, with good 
ventilation and _ natural 
lighting (window area 5-7% 
of the floor area). For 
intensive accommodation 
of tethered goats (pens are 
preferred) the stalls should 
be 75-80cm wide and 
1.50-2.00m deep, excluding 
the necessary aisles in front 
and behind. If possible, 
include a run on the south 
side, adjoining the shed.

Small sheep sheds should 
face towards the east or 
west and have many similar 
features to goat sheds 
+ p. 406. For intensive 
sheep farming, large free- 
standing sheds must offer 
different stabling options 
according to the time of 
year (winter, spring, during 
and after lambing), allowing 
segregation according to 
age and gender using 
versatile dividing fences. 
The shed _ floor is 
50-60cm below’ ground 
level and the door threshold 
20cm above ground level. 
The height difference of 
60-80 cm is filled with dung, 
which is left in place for 3-4 


months. Feeding racks 
therefore have to- be 
adjustable, either round 


(2.20m diameter) or elong- 
ated mangers (3.4m _ is 
sufficient for 25-30 sheep). 
All wooden elements of the 
building need to be raised 
15-20cm above the dung 
level because dung is 
highly saline. 

The main door should be 
at least 2.50m wide and 
2.80m high to facilitate the 
removal of dung. A shed 
height of 3.30-3.50m is 
recommended. The windows 
must be high up the wall, 
with a tilting opening 
section, and occupy the 
equivalent of 4-5% of the 
shed floor area. Between 6 
and 10% of the pen area 
should be designated as a 
feed mixing area and 
3.00m3 per sheep allowed 
for storing hay or straw.

POULTRY FARMS 


Henhouses constructed as free-standing sheds have largely 
become the norm in all areas of poultry keeping. For 
intensive farming with hens kept on the floor, the smallest 
unit when building from new is based on a shed width of 
7m; if battery coops are used, the shed width is 6-15m. The 
sheds must be thermally insulated, the optimum shed 
temperature, according to the application, being between 
15 and 22°C. 

During pre-planning it is necessary to decide on the 
method of removing droppings because the size of a cellar 
or droppings pit depends on this. Shed ventilation is 
another element that requires careful planning: 
fundamentally, they should be designed with ventilators for 
forced ventilation @ - @. 

Cellars for droppings below the battery coops need a 
longitudinal air extraction system under the service aisles. 

Ventilation systems need to have the following capacity: 

e air entry speed: 0.30 m/s (maximum 0.50 m/s) 

e in summer, air circulation for laying hens reaches a 

maximum of 10m3/h/kg bird; 

e for young hens and broilers, it is 4.00 m3/h/kg bird. 
Failure of the ventilation equipment can have a devastating 
effect in a very short time so it must have suitable warning 
mechanisms. A plan for emergency ventilation should also 
be drawn up. 

An automated round drinking trough unit is sufficient for 
75-100 hens; with channel troughs, allow 1.00m for 80-100 
hens. A tubular feeding unit is adequate for 25 hens per 
round trough (diameter 30cm).

Roughly three-quarters of 
total farm turnover comes 
from animal products and 
about half is from the keeping 
of animals for milking and 
store pig production. 

Good planning of agri- 
cultural buildings is a decisive 
factor in maintaining the 
livelihood of the farmer and 
this is particularly so for pig 
production. Specialisation 
and mechanisation of the 
production sequences will 
have the greatest influence 
on the plans. For instance, a 
vital factor in the planning 
process is to provide separate 
pig sheds for fattening and 
breeding operations. The 
considerations include: 

e how the pigs will be kept, 
which could determine the 
number of shed changes 
needed during the 
fattening period of 150-160 
days; 

e feeding techniques - by 
hand or mechanical 
trough/ground feeding; 

e removal of dung - 
dung/liquid dung (slurry). 

Intensive fattening is divided 


dry 


into two periods’ (pre- 
fattening and main fattening) 
and should not’ involve 


changing sheds within each 
period. The shed stalls have 
partially or  fully-slatted 
floors. 

The two fattening periods 
can be distinguished as 
follows: 
pre-fattening period: 

approx. 50 days 
weight in this period: 20—-40kg 
group size: 20 animals/stall 
width of feeding spaces: 
16.5cm/animal 
main fattening period: 
approx. 100 days 
weight in this period: 40—-100kg 
group size: 10 animals/stall 
width of feeding spaces: 
33cm/animal 
Dimensions for short-stall

0.34 m2/animal 
slatted dung area:

STABLES/HORSES 


Stables in which the animals are tethered in stalls are not

Stalls are preferable. Although there might be some breed- 
related behavioural features to be considered, the appropriate 
1.45~1.70 floor area of the box stall is usually based on the body length of 
the horse. However, because the length of horses is not

where W is the wither/stock height. A working value for the 
minimum length of the short sides of the stall is given by 1.5 x 
W. -> 4) + 6) Common wither heights of horses that are ridden 
2.80 are 1.60-1.65m, giving a stall floor area of approximately 
10.5 m2. 

To turn a horse safely, a stable aisle width of at least 2.50m 
is required > @) - (). In stables with tetherering stalls, provide 
an extra safety margin of 50cm for each row > @) + @). 

In addition to the stalls or boxes, consideration needs to be 
given to a saddle room, forge, sick stall and feed storage rooms. 
The saddle room should be 15m2 or more, depending on the 
number of horses. For stables housing more than 20 horses a 
forge (5.0 x 3.6m) and a stall for sick animals should be 
provided. 

Although horses are insensitive to wind (indeed, they are 
reported to have physiological need for moving air), draughts 
should be avoided. This is achieved using artificial ventilation 
equipment and air ducting — @) - @). It is not practical to 
attempt to create an ‘ideal’ stable temperature. Nor is it crucial 
because, with appropriate preparation and expert care, any 
horse can withstand winter stable temperatures as low as a few 
degrees below zero.

STABLES/HORSES 


The needs of the horses are paramount in designing stables 
and the methods of keeping them. Good design is a 
precondition not only for maintaining health, race 
competitiveness and longevity but also for ensuring the 
animals have an even temperament. Surprisingly, the 
requirements of horses today are not very different to those 
of the horses from the Asian plains which were first 
domesticated 5000 years ago.

CATTLE: STORE BULLS 


There are two methods of keeping store bulls: they are 
either kept singly or in groups => @). Keeping the animals 
singly requires constant adaptation of the stall to match the 
rapid growth of the bull and, therefore, a range of tethering 
Stalls is necessary for the different age groups. Short stalls 
are recommended for this purpose — (2) and it is important 
to ensure that the single pens have good drainage to 
remove urine from the lying area. The advantage of keeping 
the animals separately is that it eliminates herd behaviour. 

An important precondition for keeping bulls in groups 
(6-15 animals of the same age and weight) is that they must 
have become accustomed to one other from the time they 
were Calves. 

A distinction can be made between deep and flat pens 
according to the straw quantities and dung removal system. 
In deep pens the whole stall serves as the movement and 
lying area and has a straw covering whereas in flat pens the 
lying and feeding areas are separated. The standard feed 
for special store bulls is maize silage. 

When planning for store bulls, bear in mind that it must 
be possible to move single animals or whole groups into 
and out of the fattening stalls easily and in safety. 
Ventilation equipment such as convectors and extractor 
fans are recommended and these function best with a roof 
slope of around 20 degrees.

FARM FACILITIES 


Design considerations 

There are numerous factors that can influence the design of 
farm buildings. For individual buildings, it is necessary to 
consider the requirements of the following: Planning 
Authorities, Building Regulations, Water Authorities, 
Ministry of Agriculture, Health and Safety Executive, Milk 
Marketing Board, Dairy Husbandry Advisers, Welfare 
Codes, Farm Building Design Code and electricity, gas, 
telephone and water companies. 


Planning considerations 

In selecting the location a balance should be found between 
topographical and climatic conditions on the one hand and 
the business requirements on the other. For instance, 
stables require almost the same climatic conditions as 
domestic buildings so exposed areas prone to extreme 
weather should be avoided. The position of the buildings 
with respect to each other, and relative to any adjoining 
housing estates, and orientation to the prevailing wind 
direction must be carefully considered. Note that the 
prevailing wind direction in summer is more important than 
that in winter. 

Vehicles should be able to move around the farm 
without needing to use public roads. However, an effective 
link to the public road network is obviously necessary to 
allow supplies to be brought in and produce to be shipped 
out. Commercially, this connection is more important than 
arranging the farm buildings so as to be close to the fields. 
The gradients of farm roads should not exceed the 
following maxima: 5% for manually operated vehicles, 10% 
for motorised vehicles, with an absolute maximum of 20% 
for short stretches. 

In laying out the buildings the following minimum 
spacings should be maintained: at least 10m between all 
buildings and 15m between the farmhouse and stables or 
sheds > (). 

For a farmhouse and garden, about 1000 m2 is required. 
The garden should be located to the south or west of the 
house if possible and can be used also for growing fruit and 
vegetables. Typical allowances are 50-60m2 of vegetable 
plot per person and approximately 100m? of orchard per 
person.

FARM FACILITIES 


The tables presented here give guidance on the minimum 
required sizes of plot for different types of farming. 
Alternative values may be encountered depending on the 
assumptions. For example, the required plot area can be 
reduced by: 

e using tower silos instead of flat silos 

e the use of loft space instead of floor area for storage 

e storing liquid manure under the slatted floor instead 

of in outside containers 

e building up to the borders etc. 
The plot sizes given in the tables do not take into account 
the area required for storage of farm machinery, workshops 
or dwelling areas because these do not have to be 
immediately beside the buildings involved directly in 
production.

The amount of droppings and urine collected from farm 


animals depends upon the type of animal and its live weight 


rear slewing loader 







oO (expressed in livestock units, 1LU = 500kg live weight), as well 
—[_ =e fe as the type and composition of the feed and drink. Because the 
en composition of animal feed varies substantially throughout the 










solid dung year, the composition figures given here are averages. 


With normal straw quantities of 1.5 to 2kg of straw per 
LU/day, a volume of 1.00-1.25m3/LU/month is required for 
solid dung storage. With slurry (liquid manure), typical 
figures for dairy cattle are 1.4m3/LU/month while for maize- 
fed store cattle the volume is reduced to 1.0m3/LU/month. 

Among the most frequent causes of pollution from farms 
are structural failure of slurry and effluent stores, 
mismanagement and lack of maintenance of slurry 
handling systems and problems with dirty water disposal. 
National regulations have been tightened to prevent such 
problems. In England and Wales the Control of Pollution 
(Silage, Slurry and Agricultural Fuel Oil) Regulations, 1991, 
set legal minimum standards of design and construction for 
silage, slurry and agricultural fuel installations. An 
important condition that affects the siting of any such 
installation is that it must not be constructed within 10 
metres of watercourses (including land drains) into which 
silage effluent, slurry or oil could enter.

VENTILATION SYSTEMS 


The stable climate (temperature, air composition and 
humidity) has a decisive role in maintaining the health of 
animals and ventilation is, therefore, one of the most 
important considerations in shed design. The objectives of 
ventilation in livestock buildings are to supply the oxygen 
needed by the stock, remove waste (mainly heat, water, 
carbon dioxide and ammonia) and keep down the level of 
airborne micro-organisms or pathogens. Ventilation 
systems may be natural, relying on convection and wind 
currents, or forced (mechanical), using fans to propel air 
through the building.

Planning should start with a calculation of the size of the inlet and outlet air openings, 
as for mechanical ventilation. They should be calculated according to the summer air 
rates and in the case of no wind according to the following formula: 


W = gehen (m/s) Fz = ee (m2) 
1+ FA/F 3600 - w 

w= speed of outgoing air in the ridge opening (m/s) 
g = acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s?) 
H = height from stable floor to ridge opening (m) 
T, = external temperature (K) (add 273 to find temperature in °C) 
At = temperature difference between internal and external air (K) 
Vi = summer air renewal rate (m3/h) 
F, = inlet air area (m2) 


F, = outlet air area (m2)

(9) Distance between centre-lines of tracks 


The key standard distances (d) between track centre-lines 
are as listed below: 
¢ On open stretches of track 4.00m (3.5m on 


older stretches) 


— where signals are installed 4.50m 
— as safety space after every 
second track 5.40 m 
— on newly built stretches 
(V >200km/h) 4.70 m 
e In stations 4.50m (4.75m) 
— main lines, straight through 4.00m 
— in sets of 5-6 lines 6.00m 
— for brake inspection/test tracks 5.00m 
— in sidings for carriage cleaning 5.00m 


The standard gauge for the UK (and for 71% of all the 
railways in the world) is 1.435m. Tolerances on the gauge 
width are, as follows: 

—3/+30 mm on main lines 

—3/+35 mm on branch lines 
Gauges in other countries are: Russia 1.520m, Spain and 
Portugal 1.668m, South and Central Africa 1.067m, Chile, 
Argentina and India 1.673m. 

Typically, the expected life of sleepers can be taken to be 

as follows: 
timber sleepers, impregnated with creosote 25—40 years 
timber sleepers, unimpregnated 3-15years 
e steel sleepers about 45years 
© concrete sleepers (estimated) at least 60 years 


The depth of trench in a cutting should be >0.4-0.6m below 
grade and the slope of the trench 3-10%, depending on the 
type of consolidation of the trench floor. 

Ground water in the case of retaining walls must be 
conducted away by pipes or drainage holes. 

The longitudinal gradient for open stretches of main line 
should be <12.5%o, and <40%o for branch lines. For lines in 
stations it should be <2.5%o. In exceptional circumstances, 
where special permission is granted, gradients up to 25%o 
can be used on main lines. 

When stationary, the permissible wheel load is 9 tonnes. 
On stretches with sufficiently strong track and supporting 
structures, a greater wheel loading is possible (up to 12.5 
tonnes).

Curved radii (to the centre-line of the track), R: 


for direct main line fast track >300m 
for sidings in stations > 180m 
for branch lines with main line rolling stock >180m 
without main line rolling stock >100m 
for sidings, used by main line engines >140m 


for sidings, not used by mainline engines possibly > 100m 

minimum >35m 
Note that if 100m > R = 35m carriages should only be 
pulled. In addition, R >130m might not be suitable for all 
rolling stock so the types involved should be checked at an 
early stage. 


Radii for narrow gauge railways 


for 1.00m gauge track >50m 
for 0.75m gauge track >40m 
for 0.60m gauge track >25m 


For track that will be used at speeds greater than shunting 
speed, a transitional section of curve must be laid between 
the straight section and the circular arc itself, giving a 
continuous curvature change from 1:% to 1:R > @). Under 
certain circumstances the curves must be canted in order to 
keep the centrifugal force that arises during travel through 
the curve within reasonable limits. Canted curves and 
transition curves should be blended together. All details 
should satisfy the Service Regulations of the relevant 
Railway Authority. 


Sets of points are designated in accordance with the rail 
shape, the branch line’s radius and the pitch of the frog 
(e.g. 49-190-1:9). Below are example lengths of sets of 
points/switch rails: 

49-190-1:7.5 25.222 m/12.611m 

49-190-1:9 = 27.138m/10.523m 

49-300-1:9. = 33.230m/16.615m 
Carriages must not stand beyond the marker sign, to 
prevent obstructing the set of points > ©). The distance 
between the track centre-lines at the marker sign should be 
>3.5m. 


The diameters, D, of normal turntables are: for axles, 2-3m; 
for wagons, 3-10m; and for engines, 12.5-23.0m. 


The sizes of transfer tables should be calculated as 
minimum axle base of the carriage to be transferred + 0.5m. 


Details for level crossings can be obtained from the Service 
Regulations of the relevant Authority.

Other dimensions: European standards (Germany) 
For entrance doorways the clear width should be >3.35m and 
for new structures >4.00m. 

For tunnels, the extra clearance needed beyond the trains’ 
kinematic envelope clearance to the wall for a single-track 
stretch of line is 0.40m; for a double-track stretch of line it is 
30cm. 

There are minimum distances required between buildings 
and railway tracks for new structures. These vary according to 
location. Typical examples are: a fire resistant structure with 
suitable cladding must be separated by >7.50m from railway 
land; the corresponding distance for soft covered structures 
that are not fire resistant is >15m. The latter also applies to 
structures in which combustible materials are stored. 

Platform heights vary from country to country, and can be as 
small as 0.38m. However, access to platforms must not involve 
passengers having to cross the track. This requires tunnels or 
bridges, which should have a width of 2.5-4.0m. If there is 
circulation in both directions, 4.00—-8.00m is desirable. Steps on 
bridges or in tunnels should be the same width as the bridge or 
tunnel.

This information is based on the Railway Group Standard 
which applied to all new design and new route clearances 
y for railway vehicles and loads from 3 February 1996. 

| The purpose of this Railway Group Standard is to set 
down the engineering requirements for the safe passage of 
rail vehicles and their loads by reconciling their physical 
size and dynamic behaviour with the opportunities offered 
by the railway infrastructure. 

This standard applies to infrastructure owned by 
Railtrack PLC and any other infrastructure interfacing with it 
| and affecting its physical clearances (e.g. private sidings or 
| works into which, or out of which, trains will work onto 
Railtrack lines). 
| It shall be complied with in the design, maintenance and 
alteration of the railway infrastructure, in the design and 
modification of traction and rolling stock and in the 
conveyance of out of gauge loads. 

Standards are constantly evolving as faster trains are 
developed and heavier loads are transported. The national 
rail administration should, therefore, always be contacted

2 The kinematic envelope is the cross-sectional profile of a vehicle at any 
position along its length, enlarged to include the effects of dynamic sway 
and vertical movement caused by speed, (dynamic effects of) track 
curvature and cant, track positional tolerances, rail wear, rail head/wheel 
flange clearances, vehicle wear and suspension performance for the 
particular track location under consideration. The determination of the 
kinematic envelope is the responsibility of the operator of the proposed 
vehicle and shall be in accordance with the Railway Group Standard.

RAILWAY FREIGHT YARDS 


The freight yard is the traditional transfer point for goods being 
moved using a combination of rail and road transport. 

Typical functional buildings and installations are: goods 
sheds, the freight office building and perhaps a customs hall. 
The loading yard will usually have end or side platforms and 
ramps. In addition, loading gauges, sidings for bulk offloading 
(e.g. coal and oil) and transfer terminals may also have to be 
installed. And, with the increasing use of standard containers, 
additional plant such as portal cranes will also be needed. 

The effective depths for goods sheds are 10-18m or even 
16-24m, depending on the freight to be handled, and they are 
usually 3.50-5.00m high. They can consist of any number of 
bays between structural frames, at 5m centres, up to a 
maximum of 400m. 

The width of the platform on the track side of the shed 
should be at least 3.50m and for the loading dock on the service 
road side of the shed it is 2.50m. The height in both cases 
should be 1.20m above the rail level or, alternatively, the road 
surface of the freight yard. Both platform and loading dock 
should be covered by a canopy. 

The area required for goods sheds => (1) - M depends on the 
type and size of the goods and also the quantity of goods to be 
held in the store. To be able to determine the surface area 
required, the specific area needed for the types of goods 
involved (i.e. containers, pallets and goods which are not 
palletised) has to be known. A rule of thumb for values to be 
used in the calculation of the area requirement is as follows: for 
small containers with an area of 2m2, allow approximately 
6.9m2/t; for pallets, each needing 1.2-1.4m2, allow 5.6-6.5 m2/t: 
and for goods not on pallets and occupying 0.13-0.2 m2 each, 
allow 6.5-10.0m2/t. The exact storage area requirement should 
only be calculated when planning a particular project. This is 
done by carrying out a physical count of the quantity of goods 
to be stored. Peak periods of traffic movements during the week 
(for instance Saturdays or Mondays) should be taken into 
account because they can be 25-30% higher than the daily 
average. Surface area requirements for traffic movements, and 
also adequate space between the goods in the store, must be 
determined at the very outset. For small containers this can be 
80-100% of the actual space for storage, for pallets 180-210% 
and for goods not on pallets 100-160% of the storage area.

RAILWAY STATIONS 


Further information: Railtrack PLC 


Railway lines frequently pass through small and medium-size 
towns at street level, in which case the station buildings are on 
the same level as the tracks. At some small stations in continental 
Europe (e.g. Rudesheim), access to the platforms for passengers 
and luggage = (1) is achieved by crossing the tracks. Pedestrian 
tunnels are generally used for medium-size installations, such as 
Bonn — (2). In large terminals there are gently inclined tunnels for 
both pedestrians and luggage. 

An improvement in layout can be achieved by raising the 
level of the track installation, as at Cologne and Hanover, or by 
lowering the level as in Darmstadt, Copenhagen and London >

LOADING BAYS 


Gaps between dock ramps and vehicles have to be safely 
bridged to allow loading and unloading operations to be 
carried out easily and smoothly. 

Loading bridges should safely link a dock with any type 
of vehicle or railway truck. The loading platform of the 
vehicle can be either higher or lower than the ramp > (3)-(4 
and aluminium wedge-shaped units are ideal for raising low 
vehicles into line with the height of the loading dock >» (©). 
These can be mounted on rollers and easily moved to 
various work locations. Aluminium hinged loading 
platforms can be set at various levels —> (@). 

Portable loading bridges can be rolled and carried, and 
can also be used for loading on to railway trucks » @). 
Loading platforms with projecting lips are also available 
with automatic hydraulic action — (0. 

Hydraulic scissor lifts are used to adjust for differing 
levels between the yard and the vehicle platform -— 8), 
between the vehicle and the dock ramp = (7) or between two 
dock ramps. Mobile lift platforms are also available. 

Continuous height adjustment to any particular level 
during loading or unloading of the truck is best achieved 
using forklift trucks, which are available with electric, diesel, 
petrol and LPG engines > @). The height of mobile drive-on 
ramps for loading containers, lorries and railway trucks can 
be automatically adjusted according to the suspension of 
the truck during loading and unloading.

LOADING BAYS 


An example of the ideal depth of yard for articulated trucks with 
overall lengths of 18m is shown in». (@). Calculations based on 
experience show that under these conditions a length of 35m is 
required for access. Even the longest articulated truck can then be 
driven swiftly in and out. This is an important factor in controlling 
the turn-round of the vehicles on scheduled runs. If the above- 
mentioned conditions cannot be met, the saw-toothed bay layout, 
with an angle of 10°-15° offers a practical solution. 

+ @, @ + ©. 

The largest turning radius for an articulated truck is about 
12.00 m. 

The safe distance to be allowed between two adjacent trucks is a 
minimum of: 

© 1.50m with the use of a loading dock;

TURNING AND PARKING 


The type, size and shape of a turning place in a road 
depends on the road use in that particular area. It also has 
to be suitable for the needs of the road users and must meet 
town planning requirements. It is difficult to make 
recommendations for a correct choice of road turning place 
which ts valid in all cases. 

The interests of the fire and refuse collection services 
have to be taken into account in deciding on road turning 
places. Many authorities refuse to service areas with dead- 
end roads or lanes, where refuse collection lorries can turn 
only by manoeuvring backwards and forwards or must 
reverse quite a long distance. 

Road turning places can be designed as hammerheads — 
(4)- ©), turning circles or loops > 6)-@). The hammerhead type 
turning place calls for backwards and forwards manoeuvring. 

Turning circles and loops are preferable, as motor vehicles 
can drive straight round them without having to stop. 

To facilitate steering, road turning places should be 
arranged asymmetrically on the left, or on the right in the 
case of those countries like the UK which drive on the left- 
hand side of the road > 6)- @). Adequate clear areas should 
be left along the outside edges of the turning areas to 
safeguard fixed obstructions from the overhang of turning 
vehicles. In the case of turning loops, the central area to be 
driven around can be planted -> (). 

Hammerhead turning places are really only suitable for 
cars. They are not required for carriageways over 6m wide, 
if garage forecourts or footpath crossings are available for 
turning purposes.

TURNING AND PARKING 


Parking spaces are usually outlined by 12-20mm wide 
yellow or white painted lines. When parking is facing a wall, 
these lines are often painted at a height of up to 1 m for 
better visibility. Guide rails in the floor along the side have 
also proved popular for demarcation of parking limits, and 
can be about 50-60cm long, 20cm wide and 10 cm high. 
Where vehicles are parked in lines facing walls or at the 
edge of the parking deck in a multi-storey car-park, it is 
common practice to provide buffers, restraining bars or 
railings up to axle height to prevent cars from going over 
the edge. Where cars are parked face to face, transverse 
barriers about 10cm _ high can be used to act as frontal 
stops. Overhang on vehicles must be taizn into account -> 
@). For lining up in front of a wall, a stop rail or rubber buffer 
wi'3be sufficient > (). 

Garage parking spaces for cars should have an overall 
length of more than 5m and a width of 2.30m, but parking 
spaces for the disabled should be more than 3.50m wide.

TURNING AND PARKING 


Owing to the large variation in 
the size of trucks, it is not 
worth marking out permanent 
lanes or bays on the ground. 
The basic measurements for 
space and actual require- 
ments for the manoeuvring 
and parking of trucks are 
taken from the vehicle 
dimensions’ whilst driving 
straight, cornering and 
entering into or driving out of 
the parking place. The line of 
the trailing inner rear wheels

GARAGES AND CAR-PARKING 


5.40 5.50 In individual garages, two cars can 
: be parked with one above the 
other by means of mobile 
platforms — a) + @. These are 
electrically operated, but in event 
of a power failure they can also be 
actuated by a hand pump. A 
parking lift for up to three cars > 
4.90 6), serving a row of garages in a 
courtyard or multistoreyed car- 
park, can be operated from a 
control console by the doorman. 
The maximum loading for each 
parking place is 2500kg. The 
gradient for both entry and exit 
lanes of the garage is <14%. The 
2.50 2.40 4.80 59 systems shown in —> (7 - 40 place 
cars on pallets, which are then 
manoeuvred from a_ control 
console, thereby ensuring that the 
access is kept free. 

A car-moving pallet > 8 
moves the car on a platform via 
the central corridor of the garage 
to its parking place or to the lift or 
exit. Parking pallets used 
lengthways or sideways can 
improve parking capacity by 
50-80% — (7) - (10. 

Garage lift systems -> 43 - 14 
make the best use of space. The 
drivers themselves can control 
these with key switches in the 
entrance area. These garages can 
be up to 20 storeys high and 
hydraulic lifts are used for up to 10 
storeys. As the car-park is not 
used by pedestrians, the height of 
each storey can be reduced to 
> 2.10m. This type of garage saves 
space, is safe in operation, has low 
noise levels, is environmentally 
friendly and is free of exhaust

CAR-PARKS 


In accordance with the regulations applicable to garages: 

© small garages are defined as those with <100m2 effective area; 

¢ medium garages are those with 100-1000 m2 effective area; 

© large garages are those with >1000m2 effective area. 
Underground garages are defined as those with the floor level on average 
21.30m below the surface of the ground. 

Separate entrances and exits must be provided for large garages. 
These garages are normally located close to points of major traffic 
congestion such as railway stations, airports, shopping centres, theatres, 
cinemas, office and administration blocks and large residential buildings. 

Medium and large garages must be located in easily accessible areas, 
have a clear headroom of 2.00m, even below the main beams, ventilation 
ducts and other structural components. On the ground floor, this clear 
headroom is normally larger, as the space is often used for other 
purposes. 

To accommodate small transport vehicles, this height should be 
2.50m. Floor loadings must be in accordance with local standards. Open 
garages have openings which cannot be closed (equal in size to one third 
of the total area of the outside walls) leading directly into the open air and 
divided in such a way that there is continuous through-ventilation, even 
in the presence of weather screening. 

There is an ingenious example of a car-park in the centre of Geneva 
beneath the river Rhone. The entrance and exit points are on the 
approaches to the Rhone bridge — (7). Vehicles can easily filter in and out 
of the traffic flow by means of access ramps on both sides. All storeys are 
accessed by a right-hand drive up a central sloping ramp _» (7) - (@). No 
staff are necessary as there are automatic parking ticket machines in use. 

The criteria for the quality of multistorey car-parks are: safety in use, 
clear visibility, parking-space marking to enable drivers to remember the 
location of their vehicles, and integration into the context of town 
planning. 

Other factors to be considered are: natural lighting and ventilation, 
clear views to the outside, plants and greenery and a simple system of 
collecting charges.

CAR-PARKS 


Examples = () - © show how parking spaces can be 
creatively integrated into their surroundings without 
restricting their use. Parking spaces can be completely or 
partially sunken or provided with roof planting to increase 
the area of open space > @)- (©). Planting not only enhances 
the look of the area, but also provides shade and improves 
the environment by absorbing dust. 

There are various ramp systems for gaining access to 
upper and lower floors of car-parks. The gradients of the 
ramps should not exceed 15%, or in the case of small 
garages 20%. A horizontal run of more than 5m must be 
included between an area carrying general traffic and 
ramps with more than 5% gradient. For car ramps the run 
must be more than 3m long, with ramps that can be up to 
10% gradient. The options available for the arrangement 
and design of ramps can be summarised under four main 
headings > (7) - @4: 

(1) straight, parallel and continuous multi-storey ramps with 
intermediate landings, with separate ramps for up and 
down traffic located at opposite ends > (/) - (8); 

(2) sloping floors, with a full width ramp with no loss of 
space. The entire car-park structure consists of sloping 
levels. A space-saving system is shown > (@) - 40 with a 
gradient of more than 6%; 

(3) offset half storeys (D'Humy ramps); parking areas are 
offset half storeys, height is gained by the use of short 
ramps 41 - 42 and = 47 - 48); 

(4) spiral ramps - a relatively expensive design which lacks 
good visibility. The circular shape makes poor use of 
remaining areas > (3 - 46 and > 49) and @0. Spiral ramps 
must have a transverse gradient of more than 3%. The 
radius of the edge of the inner lane must be more than 5m. 
In large garages where special pedestrian routes are not 
provided, the ramps that are used by both vehicles and 
pedestrians must have a raised pavement at least 80cm 
wide. Medium-sized and large garages must have the 
following minimum width of lanes at entrances and exits: 
@¢ 3m when used by vehicles up to 2m wide; 

e 3.5m when used by wider vehicles.

CAR-PARKS 


All the load bearing components of multistorey car-parks (floors, 
walls, support columns, bracing) must be fire-resistant. Garages 
open to the air must be of fire retardant design. The 
recommended clearance height in multistorey and basement 
garages is 2.20m. It is sensible to allow an extra 25cm for 
directional signs for drivers and pedestrians. A further 5cm is 
required for subsequent repair coats to the wearing surface, 
giving a total mean height of 2.50m, plus structures above the 
access lanes, which means a height per storey of 2.75-3.50m, 
depending upon the choice of design. A relatively narrow column 
grid pattern can, with careful planning and design, reduce 
building costs and height without any loss of function > (1) + (©. 
Long span structures with no columns take up 7—12% less floor 
area than those with conventional support columns — @). 
Gradients and ramps must be appropriately shaped and 
designed — @). Straight or spiral parking ramps are constructed by 
sloping the floor. With a spiral shape — 6), you can have vehicles 
on both sides of the ramp. In it can be seen that the area 
required for a given number of cars to be parked, including the 
area required for manoeuvring, can be determined at the 
preliminary design stage. Layouts of multistoried garages and 
arrangements of ramps are shown — (7). These include two offset 
double rows of parked vehicles, four rows, six rows, parking in a 
corner, ramps in the direction of traffic, a multistorey car-park with 
egy as abo ramps and finally one with parking on a continuous helical ramp. 
B) simpler design including straight runs Reinforced concrete structures (with concrete mixed on site, 
pre-cast sections or hybrid construction) best meet the 
requirements for fire protection. As a rule, steel structures provide 
the main and subsidiary support systems and must be protected 
from fire with concrete, fire resistant cladding or other fire- 
proofing coatings. In garages, high loads should be allowed for, in 
addition to permitted superimposed loads of motor vehicles of 
3.5kN/m2, and of ramps 5kN/m2. Roofs with gardens on top have 
to be designed for a loading of 10kN/m2.

FILLING STATIONS 


Filling stations may be combined with other commercial services. The 
driver can therefore obtain fuel, oil, service and maintenance, repair work, 
Car accessories and other goods all from one location. 

lf there are a number of filling stations on the same stretch of road, 
there should be >100m between any two, or 250m if the road carries 
heavy traffic. 

On the open road, outside town limits, there should be one filling 
station for approximately every 25km. 

A plot size of about 800m? is sufficient for a basic filling station, 
RECO SEC OOL COLOR ARSED RE DARED OO EASP BOE whereas one with service facilities will require about 1000m2 and a large 
installation usually needs up to 2000 m2. 

In the last 10 years the range of petrol available at filling stations has 
increased. Most stations now offer a variety of types petrol as well as 





two-hose One-hose 
pump pump 











pe pode diesel. The design of filling stations should be flexible enough to 
pump island dimensions accommodate future requirements. 
(a) Pumps (short island, two 2-hose pumps) Filling stations should be easy to turn in to, easily visible, recognisable 
0715 0.749 from a distance and located as near to the road as possible. They should 
pe 


almost never be built in the town centre, but rather on exit roads from the 
town, by-passes and trunk roads and not where queues build up before a 
set of traffic lights. It is not good practice to site filling stations at street 
corners. A better answer is to site them just before a corner, so that 
customers can drive out of the station into a side road. 

Drivers should be able to refuel their cars, check and, where necessary, 
top up engine oil, cooling water, tyre pressure and battery fluid. Other 
services should be available, such as: checking the contents of the 
windscreen-washer bottle; cleaning the windscreen, headlights and 
hands; purchasing goods; using telephones and toilets and other facilities; 
as well as facilities for car washing, vacuum cleaning etc.

AIRPORTS: PLANNING 


The term ‘airport’ can include not only the civil airports 
familiar to holidaymakers but also airfields (which may have 
few or no associated buildings) and heliports. They may be 
divided into those which are public (i.e. accessible to any air 
travellers) and those which are private (e.g. air-freight 
terminals, company airports, aeroclubs and airforce bases). 


Location 

The choice of location for an airport will depend on 
topographical, geological and meteorological conditions as 
well as the position of surrounding built-up areas. Sufficient 
land must be available for take-off and landing runways, 
taxiways, terminal buildings, maintenance areas, fuel 
storage, etc. and, ideally, for possible future expansion. 
Another important factor is proximity to existing and 
potential transport networks. 


General expansion plan 

For all airports, an expansion plan covering at least 20 years 
ahead should be drawn up, and revised at regular intervals 
in order to allow for changes in the volume and nature of air 
traffic, developments in aircraft technology and other 
innovations. 

Traffic forecasts should include information about 
movements of aircraft, numbers of passengers and volume 
of freight. They should be checked and updated on a regular 
basis to account for the pace of modern change. For the 
calculations, and design of the airport facilities and 
installations, typical peak traffic values (i.e. those reached 
30 times per year or 10 times within the peak month) should 
be chosen, not the absolute peak values.

AIRPORTS: PLANNING 


Forward planning requires a traffic forecast based on the following 
data: 
® average/peak passenger movements (overseas/ 
domestic, arrivals/departures, transfers/transits, short- 
haul/long-haul); 
® average/peak air-freight/mail take-offs and landings 
(overseas/domestic, import/export/transfer), proportion of 
standard dimensions (containers, pallets), average/peak total 
tonnage, number of items or volume of goods); 
® average/peak movements of aircraft according to types of 
aircraft (passenger, freight, or mixed traffic). 
Other factors important to planning are: 
® choice of mode of transport by passengers (private car, taxi, 
public transport); 
® average number of people accompanying each passenger, 
average number of pieces of luggage per passenger, number 
of visitors to airport (unconnected to passengers, 
employees).

AIRPORTS: TERMINALS 


The following functional areas determine the airport capacity: 
° take-off and landing runway system (possible movements of 
aircraft per unit time); 
°® taxiways and number of arrival/departure gates; 
° passenger terminal buildings (possible movements of 
passengers, baggage and air-freight per unit time). 
The capacity of the check-in system is determined by: 
° the related road and rail systems (including parking 
provision, capacity of roads): 
® passenger/baggage check-in clearance (number of counters 
and capacity of conveyor/transport system); 
® passport control, security checks, checks prior to boarding 
the plane (size of waiting rooms, number of counters). 
The apron is the area that connects runways to the terminal. It 
includes taxiways, aircraft manoeuvring/parking areas, associated 
traffic areas and roads for service vehicles, as well as storage areas 
for service vehicles and equipment, and should therefore be 
developed in conjunction with the terminal.

AIRPORTS: TERMINALS 


Passenger terminal concepts 

Airports use different methods of accommodating aircraft 
and linking them with terminals and the main buildings. 
There are four main concepts. 


(1) Pier concept (with central main terminal >p. 448, 
6) - G7 + (5)). Aircraft park on both sides of a pier connected 
to the terminal building. Where there are two or more piers, 
the space in between has to be sufficient for 1-2 apron 
taxiways each (allowing taxiing in and out at same time). 


(2) Satellite concept (with central main terminal > p. 448, 
(4 + (6). One or more buildings, each surrounded radially 
with aircraft parking places, are connected to the main 
terminal, generally by large underground corridors. 


(3) Linear concept (> p. 448, 42+). Aircraft are parked 
alongside the terminal building in a line next to one another 
in nose-in, parallel or diagonal positions. The parking 
position determines to a great extent the overall length of 
the terminal. 


(4) Transporter concept (> p. 448, @3) + (8). Aircraft parking 
is spatially separated from the terminal and the passengers 
are taken to and from their flights by specially designed 
transport vehicles. 


Further mixed variations (hybrid concepts) can be 
developed from these basic layouts.

AIRPORTS: RUNWAYS AND APRONS 


The orientations, lengths and numbers of take-off and landing 
runways are determined by a number of factors: 

e Orientation is determined essentially by the prevailing 
local wind direction, the aim being to make it possible to 
approach the airport for 95% of the year (with a 
maximum side wind of 20 knots). Frequent strong 
crosswinds may make a corresponding second runway 
necessary > p. 446 () + ©). 

¢ Length is determined by the type of aircraft, predominant 
climatic and topographic conditions, such as 
temperature, air pressure (related to height above sea 
level), land gradient etc. 

¢ The number of runways is dependent upon the volume 
of traffic to be handled. A parallel arrangement (note that 
the minimum separation is 215m) is particularly 
advantageous and, if the separation is more than 1310m, 
simultaneous take-offs and landings are possible, which 
allows the highest theoretical capacity to be reached. 
+p. 449 

The taxiing area is to be designed in such a way that the 
runways can be cleared as fast as possible after a landing (‘fast 
exit taxiing runways’) and parking positions can be reached by 
the shortest possible routes. In especially busy airports, 
provision of overtaking areas or by-pass runways can help to 
increase capacity. 


Aircraft parking positions 

The ‘nose-in’ position (+p. 447 ()) has the following 
advantages: small space requirements; few problems with 
exhaust streams for personnel, equipment and buildings; quick 
servicing times as the necessary equipment can be made 
available before arrival; and ease of connection to passenger 
bridges. However, this position requires a means of towing for 
manoeuvring purposes and this adds time and calls for trained 
personnel. 

With ‘taxi in/taxi out’ parking (e.g. diagonal nose-in > p. 447 
2) and diagonal nose-out > p. 447 @) towing is not necessary. 
However, such parking needs a larger space and creates more 
fumes and noise pollution directly in the vicinity of the terminal 
as the aircraft are taxiing, thus making it necessary to add 
protective measures such as blast barriers. 

The parallel parking system offers the easiest manoeuvring 
for arriving and departing aircraft and there is no need for 
towing. The disadvantages are that parallel parking has the 
greatest overall space requirement and limits activity in 
neighbouring aircraft positions during taxiing. 


Apron roadways and parking spaces 

Signposting and positioning of service roadways on the apron 
are of great importance to the efficient and safe functioning of 
the airport. Apron roadways should be designed to give direct 
and safe connection of the apron to the other working areas of 
the airport. The points at which they cross aircraft taxiways or 
other service vehicle routes should be kept to the minimum. 
They can be run in front of or behind planes in the nose-in 
position, or between the wings > p. 447 @). 

Should the roadways run underneath passenger bridges, 
sufficient headroom for all service vehicles is required (usually 
4.50m minimum) > p. 449 ()+(). Because of the extensive 
mechanisation and containerisation of aircraft servicing, it is 
vital to provide enough space for loading and parking of service 
vehicles and equipment (including empty containers). 

Terminals essentially facilitate the transfer of passengers 
from ground transport (public transport, taxis, private cars) to 
the aircraft. They must therefore be planned in such a way that 
the movement of passengers and their luggage takes place 
efficiently, comfortably and quickly, and at the same time with 
the lowest possible running cost. An important criterion is 
passenger travelling distance: the distances between the car 
park/drop-off point and the main functional areas should be 
kept as short as possible. Modification to accommodate any 
increases in traffic must also be possible without radical and 
costly alterations to the original terminal.

FIRE STATIONS 


Fire stations which serve districts, and are in contact with 
accident and emergency medical departments, can often 
usefully be linked to a motorway. They can also serve as 
education and training centres, and should be equipped 
with all the necessary maintenance, support and repair 
facilities for constant readiness. Hose storage and 
maintenance equipment should be provided as well as a 













1 equipment room 5S WC drying tower which also serves as a practice tower with 
2 work room 6 group room : 

3 control room 7 practice area ladder access points. 

4 ventilation: filter room 8 heating plant room 


Clear functional areas are necessary for preparing the 
G) Basement — (9) - @) fire engines for operation: all preparation rooms should be 

: ranged along one axis leading towards the fire-engine 
z hall. 

Vehicles returning from incidents drive around the 
complex to the equipment, hose and tool return 
department, and retake their place in the fire-engine hall 
after being cleaned and prepared for operation. 

A fire station can act as emergency medical 
communication centre as well as district or regional 
control centre in the event of a large-scale emergency >

FIRE STATIONS 


A typical local fire station can be set out based on the following 
units (U): 


® four bays for the fire tenders (4U) 
® an appliance room and storeroom for special equipment (1U) 
® atraining room and a multipurpose room for 
— administration and control room staff (5U) 
— rest and recreation rooms (3U) 
— anda plant room (1U) 


A fire station for both local and area support operations, 
providing, for example, fire prevention and technical services, 
central workshop, catering, training and practice facilities, can 
contain: 


@ up to 16 fire engine bays (16 U) 
(with ambulance service, an additional 4U) 


an appliance room and storeroom for special equipment (4U) 


a training room (7 U) 

rest and recreation rooms, including washroom, 

shower, WC, changing room and drying room (4U) 
® rooms such as a duty room, restroom and small kitchen (3U) 
@ administration room and room for the station commander (1 U) 
© vehicle and equipment workshop and plant room (2U) 
© an operations control room (4U) 
e 


and a central workshop (as required). 


Where no central hose servicing workshop is available, a hose 
servicing workshop (9U) should be included and, likewise, a 
workshop for servicing breathing apparatus (4U) will be 
needed if there is no centralised service. Where central 
workshops are available, additional suitable storage rooms are 
to be included. 


Areas of the rooms —> (©) 

The size of a fire station can be estimated using units (U) 
based on the largest parking bay (55m2 or above). This 
gives an indication of the minimum sizes of the component 
rooms.

(See also pp. 255-6) 

To be able to eat comfortably, one person requires a 
table area of around 60cm wide by 40cm deep. This 
provides sufficient clearance between adjacent diners. 
Although an additional 20cm of space in the centre for 
dishes and tureens is sometimes desirable, an overall width 
of 80-85cm is suitable for a dining table. Round tables, or 
tables with six or eight sides, with a diameter of 90-120cm 
are ideal for four people and can also take one or two more 
diners. 

The minimum spaces for thoroughfares, or between a 
table and a wall are shown in @). Note that round tables 
require somewhat more floor area.

(7) Functional layout for a small restaurant 





adjoining rooms 







Before any restaurant or inn is built, the organisational 
sequence should be carefully planned. It is essential to establish 
what meals will be offered, and at what quality and quantity. It 
is necessary to decide whether it will be a-la-carte with fixed or 
changing daily menus, plate or table service, self-service or a 
mixed system. Before deciding on the layout, it is important to 
know the anticipated numbers and type of clientele and the 
customer mix. Bring in planning specialists in kitchen and cold 
store design, as well as in electrical, heating and ventilation 
systems and washing/toilet facilities. 

The position of the site will suggest what type of inn or 
restaurant is likely to be suitable. 

The main room of a restaurant is the customers’ dining 
room, and the facilities should correspond with the type of 
operation. A number of additional tables and chairs should be 
available for flexible table groupings. If appropriate, provide 
special tables for regular customers. 

Any function or conference rooms should have movable 
furniture to allow flexibility of use. A food bar may be installed 
for customers who are in a hurry. Large dining rooms can be 
divided into zones. The kitchen, storerooms, delivery points, 
toilets and other service areas should be grouped around the 
dining room, although toilets can be on another floor > 7). 

Structural columns in a dining room are best in the middle 
of a group of tables or at the corner of a table > (3). The ceiling 
height of a dining room should relate to the floor area: <50mz2, 
2.50m; >50m2, 2.75m; >100m2, >3.00m; above or below 
galleries, >2.50m. 

Guidelines for toilet requirements in inns or restaurants are 
shown in > ().

RESTAURANTS AND RESTAURANT 
KITCHENS 


Snack-bar layouts — (1) can be suitable for up to 60 seats in 
eating houses with fast turn-around times (five or six 
seating changes at lunchtime; two in the evenings). In 
between meal times, coffee, cakes and sandwiches can be 
served. The kitchen mainly makes use of ready-made items, 
and daily deliveries mean that stores do not need to be 
particularly large. 

A café restaurant > @) with a tea room is usually a town- 
centre business located in a busy area. A café does not 
serve alcoholic drinks except for premium bottled beers, 
liqueurs etc., and specialises in hot and cold patisserie and 
snacks. Tea rooms serve alcohol-free drinks, patisserie and 
sandwiches, and have capacity for about 150 seats. They 
normally open from 11.00 to 17.30 p.m. They serve mainly 
pre-made meals, and therefore need little storage space. 

A restaurant kitchen in a large hotel > @) caters for one 
or more large restaurants with adjoining rooms, and 
sometimes supplies external locations or businesses. May 
have to feed 800-1000 people. The waiters’ walkway may 
be in the centre, with special serving counters in the garden, 
or possibly of the bowling alley type with direct access to 
adjoining rooms. The kitchen is arranged in a cellular 
system, with large appliance blocks. 

A restaurant with a buffet and vending machines > @ 
provides a fast luncheon service for working people in 
restaurants, canteens, department stores and motorway 
service stations. Their capacity is about 500 people per 
hour. The kitchen only completes ready-prepared meals, 
except for salads and ice cream. 

Self-service restaurants —> (5) are suitable for department 
stores or in office blocks. Nothing is made on the premises. 
All supplies are ready-made and deep frozen.

Bistros, snack-bars, small cafés, or speciality restaurants

medium units with 70-100 seats, on the other hand, require 
carefully zoned and fully fitted kitchen systems. Large 
restaurants (motorway service stations, fast restaurants, 
large hotel operations) often achieve considerably higher 
place numbers, frequently with integrated meal bar or self- 


service areas.

RESTAURANT KITCHENS 


The trend away from conventional restaurants to those 
offering a wide range of gastronomy not only affects the 
planning of dining rooms but also of kitchens. Small and 
medium-sized restaurant kitchens play a very important 
role here, and the following details are primarily aimed at 
such restaurants. 

In the ‘Gastronorm’ system, the dimensions of 
containers, tables, shelves, equipment and crockery, as 
well as built-in units, are all based on a 530mm x 325mm 
module. 

The function and organisation of the restaurant kitchen 
is Summarised in @) + @. The capacity of the kitchen is 
primarily dependent on the number of customer seats, 
customer expectations (type, extent and quality of the 
meals offered), and the proportion of raw materials which 
have to be freshly prepared (as opposed to ready- 
prepared food), as well as the frequency of customer 
changes over the whole day or at busy periods (consumer 
frequency). 

In fast restaurants about three seat changes per hour 
can be expected; in conventional restaurants only about 
two. In speciality and evening restaurants customers stay 
on average 1.3-2 hours. 

The percentage of the whole floor area required for 
each section > @, and the detailed requirements for 
special purposes —> @), can be calculated in relation to 
small, medium and large kitchens. 

Aisle widths in storage, preparation and production 
areas are different according to whether they are purely 
traffic routes, or if they also lead to service areas. Working 
aisle widths should be 0.90-1.20m, local traffic routes with 
(occasional) additional usage 1.50-1.80m and main traffic 
routes (transport and two-way through traffic) 
2.10-3.30m. Aisle widths of 1.00-1.50m should be 
sufficient for small to medium-sized restaurant kitchen 
areas.

RESTAURANT KITCHENS 


‘Hot kitchens’ contain finishing zones and some or all of the 
following equipment depending on their main function: cooker 
(two to eight rings), extractor hood, water boiler, automatic 
cooker, steamer, automatic steamer, pressurised steamer, 
convection ovens, water bath (bain-marie), baking and roasting 
oven, frying and grilling plates, frying pans, double-decker 
roasting oven, deep fryer, salamander, air circulation equipment 
(for deep-frozen goods), microwave oven and automatic through- 
flow frying and baking oven. Large automatic units are only 
found in very large kitchens. The main units should be arranged 
in a block in kitchens serving more than 100-200 meals or with 
more than 30m2 of space available. In even larger kitchens, over 
50m2, finishing groups can be arranged as double blocks. 
Storage space and working surfaces should be conveniently 
placed between the units at the end of blocks > (4) - ©). 

In the ‘cold kitchen’, the layout should be logically planned in 
parallel with the hot kitchen and convenient for the (common) 
servery and bread area. The main fittings for a cold kitchen are a 
day refrigerator under/over the cold table, diverse cutting 
machines (bread, meats and cheese), mixing machine, scales, 
cutting boards, salad table with a lower cold cabinet, toaster or 
salamander, microwave, and sufficient working and storage 
surfaces > 6). 

The meal servery for a restaurant kitchen with a counter or bar 
serving point is best located between the preparation area and 
the dining room. There should be an adequate storage surface, a 
hot cabinet with heated table plates, and a cool zone for cold 
meals. A crockery shelf or attachment, a cutlery container, and 
basket and plate dispensers are also necessary for large 
restaurants. 

It is important to separate pot washers and dishwashers. With 
waiter service, crockery is returned via the servery in the waiter’s 
own area > (12) - @5). There should be one or two rinsing sinks 
with draining surfaces, storage surfaces and shelves for pot 
washers. All other items should go into automatic dishwashers of 
suitable capacities fitted below the work surfaces. Rules should 
be laid down for loading and operating the dishwashers. 
Through-flow and circulation units are also necessary. Provide 
side storage and working surfaces for returns, and sorting, 
soaking and locating surfaces for crockery > (2 — @4). 

About 10-15% of the kitchen area should be reserved for 
offices and staff rooms. Kitchen staff must be provided with 
changing rooms, a washroom and toilets. If more than ten staff 
are employed, rest and break rooms are required. Changing and 
social rooms should be close to the kitchen to avoid the staff 
having to cross unheated rooms or corridors (there is an 
increased risk of draughts in hot workplaces). More than 6m2 
should be provided for the changing room, with four to six air 
changes per hour as well as visual screening. Provide a well- 
ventilated, lockable cupboard for each worker. In large kitchens 
there may be cupboards for street and working clothes. The 
minimum requirements of local workplace regulations should be 
used for the dimensions and fittings of the washing and toilet 
areas. Other guideline values for toilet systems are 5-6m?2 per WC 
seat and wash basin unit, and about 5.5m2 per wash basin and 
shower unit, for five or more male or female workers. 

Large kitchens must be equipped with a mechanical 
ventilation system according to current guidelines. Waste air 
must be extracted at each cooking point, with extraction pipes to 
the outside via a ducting system. Fresh air must be drawn in, i.e. 
recirculated air is not permitted.

LARGE KITCHENS 


Group-catering for large numbers of people in office blocks, 
hospitals, factories, etc., requires  labour-saving 
mechanisation, electronic data processing (DP) and 
automatic units, i.e. the ‘programmed kitchen’ from the 
meals plan, through goods procurement to meal distribution 
and crockery cleaning > @) for more than 800-1000 table 
places and different dishes. Preparation tables and the meal 
servery are heated by steam or electricity. The surface 
temperature of table plates should be 60°C. 

The advantage of such a system is that data about calorie 
content, nutritional value, vitamins and minerals, etc., are 
saved and are immediately available, and stores levels and 
Order requirements are automatically updated. The 
preparation machinery is in continuous use, and the work 
sequence is controlled on a time basis. This covers the 
transport — () of unit containers — @), an automatic through- 
flow roaster — © and cooker = (7), modern cooking processes 
for potatoes and vegetables, quick frying methods using little 
fat, fish cooked in a water bath, and thermal grilling. The 
automatic equipment is arranged in a flow system from 
loading to distribution — @). Heating is by electricity or gas. 

These serving systems are for pure catering operations 
such as hospitals, residential homes, canteens and 
cafeterias > @,@),Q). 

Fully automatic crockery cleaning is also installed, using 
sorting and clearing equipment, and automatic removal of 
cutlery, dishes and cups. The cleaning and drying system 
should be suitable for the type of crockery, and automatic 
clearance of tray trolleys. Return transport of used crockery 
is via a transport conveyor to the washing kitchen — ().

Layout and area requirements 

Different types of hotel offer varying standards of quality and 
facilities. Hotels may be part of a chain or independent. Where 
hotels do form part of a chain, special design requirements may 
be imposed. Hotel types include town hotels, holiday hotels, 
clubs, hotels with apartments and motels. 

Accommodation facilities, including rooms, toilets, 
bathrooms, shower rooms, etc., hallways and floor service, 
should occupy 50-60% of the floor area. Public guest rooms, a 
reception area, hall and lounges require 4-7%, and hospitality 
areas, restaurants, and bars for guests and visitors 4-8%. A 
banqueting area with meeting and conference rooms needs 
4-12%, domestic areas, kitchens, personnel rooms and stores

HOTEL LAYOUT AND AREA 
REQUIREMENTS 


9-14%, administration, management and secretarial 1-—2%, 
maintenance and repair 4-7%, and leisure, sport, shops and a 
hairdressing salon 2—10%. 

Special areas for seminars, health centres and outdoor 
facilities, for which the space required can vary tremendously, 
may also be needed. 

National systems of classification, compulsory or voluntary, 
vary in range of categories and method of designation (letters, 
figures, stars, crowns etc.). Over 100 classification systems are 
in use, most based on the World Tourism Organisation (WTO) 
model but customised to suit local conditions.

HOTEL LAYOUT AND AREA 
REQUIREMENTS 


Hotels offer different types of accommodation, including bedrooms, 
suites, self-catering units and apartments using the hotel services > 
() - @). The size and number of beds largely dictates dimensions 
and layout of rooms, e.g. twin 100/200cm, double 150/200cm, 
queen-size 165/200cm, or king-size 200/200cm. Rooms may include 
a sitting area with chairs, a desk, TV, self-service drinks refrigerator 
and Suitcase stand. 

Corridor space should be about 6m2 per room, and normally at 
least 1.5-1.80m wide. Separate routes should be provided for 
guests, staff and goods > (1) - ©. 

There is always movement in and near a hotel. Customers move 
from parking areas, through the entrance and reception, and then to 
lifts, staircases or corridors leading to bedrooms or public rooms. In 
most hotels, customers are not allowed to go from bedrooms direct 
to the car park without passing through reception. Suitable fire 
escape routes must be provided to meet legislation. Staff move from 
staff housing, via their own entrance and changing rooms, to 
kitchens, service areas, bars, workshops, etc. All deliveries must be 
taken to the correct department or storage area, perhaps using 
special lifts. Disposals should be from special roofed-over areas (to 
limit night-time noise), with a clearance height of 4.35m. 

Hotels usually have a restaurant and/or breakfast area and one or 
more bars. Hotels with conference facilities may include a 
multifunctional central hall, meeting rooms, exhibition areas and 
buffet facilities. Storage for extra furniture and additional parking 
space may be necessary. Specialist facilities may include audio- 
visual media rooms, projection equipment, simultaneous translation 
facilities, copying machines, fax machines and telephones. 

Hotels should provide facilities for the handicapped and disabled 
in at least 1-2% of rooms, preferably on the ground floor, and with 
the following minimum criteria: ramps 1:20, corridors 915mm wide, 
doors 815mm clear opening, lobbies 460 mm wider than the door on 
the latch side, closet doors either narrow or sliding, shelves 1.37m 
high. Bathrooms: central turning space 1.52m, width 2.75m, vanity 
tops 860mm high, 685mm knee space, mirrors extending down to 
1.0m, compromise toilet seat height usually 430mm. Grab bars are 
needed on the headwall and sides of the bath and toilet. Standard 
bedrooms, 3.65m wide, can be adapted to the following criteria: 
switches 1.2m high, space between beds and furniture 910mm, 
beds 450-500mm high with toe space below. Eye level from a 
wheelchair is 1.07—1.37m; dressing tables should allow for this and 
have 685mm knee space. Low window sills are also preferable.

MOTELS 


Motels are located on motorways and arterial roads near large 
towns, and tourist and holiday areas. Ideally, restaurants, petrol 
station(s) and car servicing should be available in the immediate 
locality. A motel should be positioned so that car headlights do not 
affect the residents. 

The reception area should be close to the rooms, with short-term 
parking and one entry/exit point only. 

Motels are generally one or two storeys and widely spaced out 
+ @), @. Room sizes are between 4m x 4m and 5m x 5m, plus 
bathrooms and cooking facilities if provided > (8). Repetitive units 
may be arranged in pairs or clusters around a central service core, 
or in blocks with continuous or stepped facades, in courtyards or in 
other combinations to suit site contours, parking arrangements and 
boundaries. Parking is communal or immediately adjacent to the 
rooms. Motel units often provide convertible double/family rooms 
and sometimes self-catering kitchenettes. Access to rooms may be 
direct (ground floor) or via corridors or stairs. 

Since about 90% of guests stay only one night, wardrobes often 
have no doors so that the contents can easily be seen and are less 
likely to be forgotten. 

A well-equipped common room for guests is often provided, as 
well as a central laundry. Playgrounds should be well away from the 
motel so as not to disturb those wishing to sleep.

YOUTH HOSTELS 


Youth hostels are often conversions of existing buildings partly 
because of a shortage of money and also because they are often

olice/Feceptionishop Dee ne nore Association (YHA) in the UK is therefore reluctant to lay down

be allowed if DFEE standards are to be met.

switching to the four-bed dormitory arrangement used in many

of privacy for women’s washing arrangements. This can be achieved 
by arranging wash basins in cubicles with curtained entrances.

Amenities 

As hostels are generally closed during the day, a secure luggage 
room without access to the rest of the hostel must be provided so 
arriving members can store their gear. This could be part of the 
drying room, where hostellers remove their outer clothing before 
booking in at the reception desk. 

To allow visitors to cook their own meals a members’ kitchen 
should be provided in all hostels in addition to the kitchen for the 
warden, who will also cook for hostellers. These kitchens should be 
equipped with double cooking rings and grill units, fuelled by 
propane if no mains service is available. Lockers and washing-up 
space are also required.

largest hostels can have assistant wardens, who could potentially 


need their own recreation rooms and a staff kitchen and dining room. 





ground floor first floor In large hostels, the chief warden’s quarters should be in the 
form of self-contained houses or flats, with three bedrooms, a

YOUTH HOSTELS 


A distinction is made by the German Youth Hostel 
Association between youth hostels and youth hotels. The 
former are usually in the country and include children’s 
hostels for children up to 13 and youth hostels for 13-17- 
year-olds, although there is usually an age overlap. Youth 
hotels are in towns and cities with tourist and cultural 
attractions, and there is an international trend towards a 3- 
star hotel standard with 120-160 beds. 

Youth hostels and hotels have a variety of purposes: 
accommodation and meeting point for conferences, 
courses, seminars, educational courses for young people 
and adults, recreation, school trips, individual and family 
hiking. 

The functional areas required include common rooms 
and dayrooms (one per 20-25 beds), several dining rooms 
(some of which can also be used for meetings and 
functions), multi-use circulation spaces with more 
secluded bays, cafeteria, lecture rooms, entrance 
hall/reception and office for youth hostel warden. The 
areas required are dependent on the number of bed 
spaces. Outside, there may be requirements for a camp 
site (with doors to sanitary facilities), sports and games 
pitches, parking for buses and cars, and a garden for the 
hostel warden. 

There is a trend to reduce the numbers of beds in the 
hostel rooms to between four and six (eight maximum) 
and to have separate rooms for parents and children. In 
youth hotels there are usually two to four beds and single 
rooms are available for group leaders and visiting 
speakers. 

Showers and washrooms must be near to all rooms 
and separate WCs provided. All should be accessible to 
the disabled. A lockable luggage store and cleaning rooms 
are desirable on each floor.

ZOOS AND AQUARIUMS 


The Zoological Society of London, founded in 1826, and its 
Zoological Gardens, opened in 1828, both had considerable 
influence on the development of animal research and 
collections throughout the world. The traditional role of 
zoological gardens (for education and scientific research) 
has become increasingly important because of the 
accelerating decimation of wildlife stocks. Zoos have 
expanded into breeding and preservation of different 
species as well as the return of animals to the wild. Many 
important specialist collections have recently been formed 
by private owners. 

The following list shows examples of area requirements: 


Cologne 20 ha 1860 
Nuremberg 60 ha 1939 
Sao Paulo 250 ha 1957 
Healsville 175 ha 1964 
Brazilia 2500 ha 1960 
Abu Dhabi 1430 ha 1970 
Berlin 34 ha 1983 
Frankfurt 63 ha in construction 
Naples 300 ha in construction 


The main entrance of the zoo has: window displays; cash 
desks and information kiosks; WCs; large parking areas for 
cars and coaches; stops for public transport. It is also 
usually the location for: administration; all departments 
serving the public; function/lecture rooms plus a high-class 
restaurant overlooking the zoo area (all with separate 
entrances from outside for evening business). Other 
restaurants, self-service cafeteria, WCs and picnic areas 
can be sited within the zoo. 

Operations departments should have separate entrances 
and be shielded from public view; they need large external 
areas for storage of feed, litter materials, hay, straw, sand, 
gravel, soil, building materials, etc. Within the buildings 
should be washing (plus disinfection) and changing 
facilities, cafeteria, training and quiet rooms (night 
watchmen). Provision should also be made for central and 
local feed preparation, water treatment, waste disposal, 
sheds for accommodating and servicing cleaning machines, 
transport units, low-loaders, transport cages and gardening 
equipment. Workshops are needed for carpenters, fitters 
and painters, including the necessary storage space. Other 
facilities include an animal hospital, quarantine stations, 
research laboratories, settling and rearing areas, carcass 
storage (cold stores) and disposal. Heating, air-conditioning 
and ventilation for all need to be planned. 

Main paths, 5-6 m wide, for the public should form loops 
linking the main buildings and animal enclosures; 
secondary routes, 3-4m wide, give access to the individual 
groups of animals. Paths and buildings should all be 
accessible to wheelchairs. It is important to create a feeling 
of seclusion by planting and sculpting the landscape. 
Service routes, for supplying and transporting animals to 
the enclosures, should cross the main routes as little as 
possible. Public transport systems: consider electric trolleys 
using the main paths, or miniature trains/cable railways 
with their own tracks or routes. 

An important consideration is the means of separating 
the animals and the public: wire and steel netting (black), 
chains, water-filled and dry ditches, glass and plastic 
barriers, electrified fences. 

The native climate/geography and _ social/territorial 
needs of the animals must always be taken into account, 
although some acclimatisation may be possible. The design 
should allow enclosures to be split (either in or out of public 
view) for reproduction and rearing. Equipment for catching 
and transporting animals must be accommodated. For 
Open-air enclosures scents and wind direction are 
important criteria governing locations and fencing.

Stee yess Buildings to house birds must allow sunlight to enter, 
ek, aN particularly for tropical birds; outside enclosures for

en enone Most reptiles and marine mammals require 
temperatures between 15 and 27°C. They should have an 
adequate volume of water and allow sufficient ‘haul-out’ 
space. 

Fish and invertebrates must not come into contact with 
water containing metal particles. Mains water must first be 
filtered with carbon. A distinction is made between ‘open 
systems’ with single throughflow (1-2 water changes per 
hour) and ‘closed systems’ with filter and recirculation 
(6-20% water renewal in two weeks). Fresh and sea water 
reserves of 30-50% of the total volume should be held. 
Lighting of aquariums requires particular care to harmonise 
with the creatures’ natural habitat and to avoid reflection in 
the display tank surfaces. 

Terrestrial invertebrates (insects) in aquariums or 
terrariums require extensive safety precautions to avoid 
eggs or larvae being introduced into the local environment.

ZOOS AND AQUARIUMS 


The preservation of animals, together with their 
renaturalisation, is a key concern. Peripheral zoo areas 
should also include exhibits which help to explain the 
interrelationships between humankind and_ nature, 
bordering on the educational function of natural science 
museums. 

For the medical care of animals, plus research and 
reproductive support, zoos have developed clinics and 
" ee hospitals not open the public >@ -©). External enclosures 

oa support the healing process, acclimatisation and 
sat quarantine. Elements include: 

| e padded stalls for recovery, acclimatisation and 
observation (inside and outside) 
separate access routes to the building, including 
isolated paths for transport cages

THEATRES: HISTORICAL SUMMARY 


Theatre planning requires an understanding of complex 
functional relationships which can, in part, be gained by 
examining the 2500-year-old history of theatre develop- 
ment. The examples shown here and on the following page 
give an insight into the tradition of theatre building, the 
principles of which are still in use today, although 
contemporary architects are increasingly injecting modern 
thinking into theatre design. 

Dionysos Theatre, the start of European theatre building 
+ @). Marcellus Theatre, the first theatre in Rome built 
entirely of stone > @). Medieval stage theatre, temporary 
platform and fittings = @. Inner room of the Swan Theatre 
from a drawing by Van de Wit in 1596 — @). Italian theatre 
from the start of the 16th century > ©). Early Renaissance 
theatres were temporary wooden structures in existing 
halls, e.g. Vasari developed a wooden reusable system for a 
theatre in the Salone dei Cinquencento Palazzo Vecchio in 
Florence. The Teatro Olimpico in Vicenza > ©). The first 
permanent theatre building of the Renaissance was the 
Comédie Frangaise in Paris > (@%. Boxes were first built in 
the mid-17th century. Teatro Farnese in Parma — (8 was the

THEATRES: HISTORICAL SUMMARY 


The Bayreuth Festival Theatre — (1) With his theatre form, R. 
Wagner erected a counterpoint to the Grand Opéra House in Paris. 
Total theatre project by W. Gropius/E. Piscator. To note: rotating 
audience space, stage with paternoster system — projection options 
on walls and ceiling > @)- @) Dessau Regional Theatre — (4). Early 
example of a modern stage system with sufficient secondary 
stages. Draft for the National Theatre in Mannheim — (5). Theatre on 
Lehniner Platz, Berlin, the first large new building with a flexible 
theatre space (conversion of the Mendelsohn building ‘Universum’ 
from 1928) s ©). Opéra Bastille, Paris —» (7), the previous largest 
stage system with ten secondary stages on two levels. 





Trends in current theatre building 
There are two trends today. 
Architects: R. Wagner and O. Bruckwald 1 Preservation, restoration and modernisation of the 
Q) ine Festival ‘Theatre "Bayreuth: 3876 previous theatres of the 19th and up to the middle of the 
20th century. 

2 New buildings with ‘experimental’ open space features, 
e.g. Theatre on Lehniner Platz, Berlin > 6). In a similar 
direction are the many conversions from previous rooms 
to theatre workshops with seats for about 80-160 
onlookers. 

Opera and theatre: There are two different expressions of 
theatre building: the opera and the theatre. 
The opera is in the tradition of the Italian opera buildings of the 
18th and 19th centuries — p. 476 6) + (oO. It is characterised by a 
clear spatial-architectural separation between the audience area 
and the stage by the orchestra pit, and through large seat 
numbers (1000 to almost 4000 seats), as well as the corresponding 
box system and the circles necessary for large numbers of 
spectators, e.g. Teatro allo Scala (Milan) with 3600 seats, Deutsche 
Oper (Berlin) with 1986 seats, Metropolitan Opera (New York) with 
3788 seats, Opéra Bastille (Paris), 2700 seats > p. 476. As a 
counterpoint to the opera form as circle/box theatre is the The 
Festival Theatre, Bayreuth. This is conceived as a Stalls theatre on 
the Greek/Roman principle and has only 1645 seats. 
The theatre is structurally in the tradition of the German 
reform theatres of the 19th century. It is characterised by the 
Stalls arrangement (i.e. the audience sit in a large ascending 
curved area) and by a distinctive, front acting stage (an acting 
area in front of the proscenium in the auditorium). Theatres, 
however, particularly seek the tradition of the English theatre — p. 
476 (), i.e. an acting area in the auditorium. 
(4) Dessau Regional Theatre, 1938 (regional theatre), A modern example from the English speaking area is the 
plan view of upper circle Chichester Festival Theatre, England, by Powell & Moya, 1962. 
ia oe oS oo oe One example in Germany is the Mannheim National Theatre, 

2s small theatre, Weber, Hamer, Fischer 1957. 

The variable open room form was intensified by the room 
experiments of the theatres in the 1970s, e.g., Concordia 
Theatre, Bremen, (conversion of a one-time cinema). Room 
variation options are shown in the Theatre on Lehniner Platz, 
Berlin > p. 476 ©). 

A speciality in the German-speaking area is the 
multipurpose theatre (mixed form of opera house and theatre) 
which is characterised by the dominating requirements of the 
opera, e.g., Stadttheater Heilbronn, Biste & Gerling, 1982.

THEATRES: AUDITORIUMS 


Audiences: assessing demand 
An important element of a feasibility study is the assessment of 
demand for performing arts within the community that the facility is 
proposed to serve. The aim is to establish whether there are 
audiences for the proposed programme of use, and to define a 
catchment area from which audiences are to be drawn. Assessment 
of the area under consideration includes studies of: 

© population characteristics 
transportation characteristics 
potential audiences 
local cultural traditions 
existing provision 
actual audiences 
pilot scheme. 


Auditorium and stage/playing area 

Seating capacity: In general, the maximum Capacity of an 
auditorium depends on the format selected, and on aural and visual 
limitations set by the type of production. Other factors include 
levels, sightlines, acoustics, circulation and seating density, as well 
as size and shape of platform/stage. 

Size of auditorium: An area of at least 0.5m2 per spectator is to 
be used for sitting spectators. This number is derived from a seat 
width x row spacing of at least 0.45m2 per seat, plus an additional 
minimum of 0.5m x 0.9m i.e. approximately 0.05 m2 per seat » (1). 

Length of rows: A maximum of 16 seats per aisle (3). 25 seats 
per aisle is permissible if one side exit door of 1m width is provided 
per 3-4 rows -> @). 

Exits, escape routes: 1m wide per 150 people (min. width 0.8m) 
+@)-@. 

Volume of room: This is obtained on the basis of acoustic 
requirements (reverberation) as follows: playhouses approx. 
4-5m3/spectator; opera approx. 6-8m3/spectator of air volume. For 
technical ventilation reasons, the volumes should be no less than these 
figures so as to avoid air changes which are too pronounced (draughts). 

Proportions of auditorium: These are obtained from the 
spectator's psychological perception and viewing angle, as well as 
the requirement for a good view from all seats. 

* Good view without head movement, but slight eye 

movement of about 30°. 
* Good view with slight head movement and slight eye 
movement approx. 60° 5 (7). 

°¢ Maximum perception angle without head movement is about 
110°, i.e. in this field everything which takes place ‘between 
the corners of the eyes’ is perceived. There is uncertainty 
beyond this field because something may be missed from the 
field of vision. 

° With full head and shoulder movement, a perception field of 

360° is possible. 


Proportions of the classical auditorium 
(Opera, multipurpose theatre, traditional playhouse) »(/): Maximum 
distance of last row from the proscenium line (‘start of stage’): 

° for playhouse —- 24m (maximum distance from which it is still 

possible to recognise facial expressions) 

° for opera - 32m (important movements still recognisable). 
Width of auditorium: This is derived from the fact that spectators 
sitting to one side should still be able to see the stage clearly . (7). 
Variants are possible. The comfortable proportions and often good 
acoustics of the classical theatres of the 18th and 19th century are 
based on special rules of proportion (9) - (0.

THEATRES: AUDITORIUMS 


Elevation of seating 

Elevation of seating (gradient) in the auditorium is obtained 
from the lines of vision. Such lines are valid for all seats in the 
auditorium (stalls as well as circles) > @). Since the spectators 
sit in ‘gaps’, only every second row requires full sight elevation 
(12cm). Special mathematical literature addresses the subject 
of sight problems in theatres in which the randomness of the 
distribution of different sizes of spectators is also taken into 
account. The rows of spectators should be formed in a circular 
segment with respect to the stage, not just for better alignment 
but also to achieve better mutual perception (feeling of 
integration) > @). 


Complete vertical section through auditorium 

The proscenium height should first be determined. The ratio in 
a stalls theatre of proscenium height to width should be 1:6. The 
golden section, or the physiological perception field, is included 
in this > ©). After the proscenium height, the apron height, the 
banking of the stalls and the volume of the auditorium are 
determined; the lines of the ceiling are obtained from the 
acoustic requirements. The aim should be for the reflected 
sound from the stage or apron to be equally distributed 
throughout the auditorium. In the case of circles, it should be 
ensured that the full depth of the stage can be seen, even from 
the upper seats. This might require an increase in proscenium 
height. 

The proportions of an experimental auditorium are shown 
on the following page. 

Neutral or open theatre auditoriums permit different 
arrangements of spectator seating and stage areas. This 
variable arrangement is achieved in two ways: 

(A) mobile staging and mobile spectator stands with a fixed 

auditorium floor 

(B) movable floor consisting of lifting platforms. 

Method A is technically more complicated and more expensive, 
and is therefore used only in larger auditoriums for at least 
150-450+ people. Type B is especially suitable for smaller 
theatres and unused rooms which normally have insufficient 
subspace. 

99 seats x 0.6m2 needs a stage area of 60m2 (2/3) + 30m2 
(1/3) i.e. 90-100 m2. 

A room proportion of 1:1.6 is the best option for multiple use 
(see @)-@) on the following page). 


Vertical room section 
In simple auditoriums, the lighting rig is unnecessary > (2) - @). 
Instead, manual hoists can be provided (bars which are pulled 
up to the ceiling with hand winches). Two examples are shown 
on the next page: a small theatre in Munster (Architect: v. 
Hansen, Rane, Ruhnau,1971), 170-380 seats, mid-section of floor 
is variable with lifting stage sections, acting stages (1) - @) and 
Ulm podium (Architect: Schafer, 1996), 150-2000 seats @)- @. 
Larger type B has 450+ seats. It is designed like small type A, 
but with a mobile floor to simplify change in the floor 
topography. One problem is the size and lifting accuracy of the 
stage sections. Often, the rough topography of the stage 
sections has to be modified by manually arranging platforms to 
give fine topography —> p. 480 @). See Theatre on Lehniner Platz, 
Berlin > p. 477 ©).

STAGES AND SECONDARY AREAS 


Proportions of Stages, 
Secondary Stages and Stores 


Stage forms 
There are three stage forms: full stage, small stage and set 
areas. 

Full stage: More than 100 m2 of stage area. Stage ceiling 
more than 1m above top of proscenium arch. An essential 
feature of a full stage is an iron safety curtain which 
separates the stage from the auditorium in the event of an 
emergency. 

Small stage: Area no more than 100m2, no stage 
extension (secondary stages), stage ceiling not more than 
1m above top of proscenium. Small stages do not require 
an iron safety curtain. 

Set areas: Raised acting areas in rooms without ceiling 
projection. The peculiarity with set areas is in the 
regulations with respect to curtains and scenery. They affect 
the operation, not the planning, of set areas. Experimental 
auditoria fall within the set area definitions. 


Stage proportions 
Stage proportions are developed from the lines of vision 
from the auditorium. The stage area is the playing area plus 
walkways (around the back of the stage) and working areas. 
The principle design of a traditional full stage > @)- ©. 
Mobile set areas are formed from height-adjustable 
platforms or lifting podia. Variable shapes are achieved by 
splitting the area into individual elements. Basic 
dimensions 1m x 2m > @)-@. 


Stage ventilation 

Means should be provided for ventilating smoke and hot 
gases resulting from fire on the stage, e.g. provision of 
haystack lantern light or fire ventilator sited in highest point 
in roof over stage and as near to centre of stage as is 
reasonably practicable. An additional fresh air inlet may 
prove effective.

STAGES AND SECONDARY AREAS 


Adjacent (Secondary) Stages and 
Scene Changing Technology 


The classical stage systems in the 18th and 19th centuries

STAGES AND SECONDARY AREAS 


Secondary Areas 


Open stages require secondary areas for the sets, and 
storage areas for platforms and stands — around 30% of the 
whole room. (The secondary areas should be the same size 
as the playing area; and the space required for storage 
areas can be calculated from the folded platforms and 
stands.) 

Open stages require considerably less scenery than 
normal stages because the playing area is viewed from 
several sides. 

Regulations limit the use of scenery for safety reasons 
> @. 

Storage rooms are used for the stage items and scenery. 
They can be subdivided into: sets, back-drop, furniture, 
props store, store for costumes, hats, shoes, masks, wigs, 
lighting, etc. 

Scenery and costume stores need the greatest amount 
of space. 

Scenery store: (particularly for heavy parts) at stage 
height and in the immediate vicinity of the stage. Rough 
values for the dimensions of scenery and costume stores 
can be obtained from the number of productions in the 
repertoire. For theatres and multipurpose theatres, this is 
normally 10-12; for opera, it is up to 50 productions and 
more. 

Per play/production, around 20-25% of the playing area 
is required as storage area, i.e. for theatres about three 
times the playing area, and for opera, at least ten times. 
Practice has shown that, with time, the stores turn out to be 
too small; therefore, theatres and, especially, operas create 
storage areas outside the theatre. 

The significant amount of transporting has inevitably led 
to the introduction of the most up-to-date transportation 
and storage technology: container systems with computer- 
controlled storage. 

Around 2-4 containers are required per production 
(special operas may require up to 12 containers). 

Examples: the Deutsche Oper (Berlin) stores are in direct 
connection with the stage — @); the National Theatre 
(Mannheim) storage is outside the theatre, in containers 
~ ©). 

Surface area required for costumes is also calculated 
according to the number of productions in the repertoire 
and the size of the ensemble (e.g. opera) apart from the 
performers, the choir and ballet. Space requirement for 
costumes: 1-—12cm/costume or 1-15 costumes per rod

rooms were placed on either side of the stage: women to the

the operation, so, nowadays, personnel rooms are built on one 
side, opposite the technical side, and on several floors. Here 
also are found the mask-making shops, frequently also the 
costume workshop, administration and directors.

STAGES AND SECONDARY AREAS 


Rehearsal Rooms 

To reduce the load on the main stage, every theatre must have 
at least one rehearsal stage e.g. in a small theatre, the scenery 
for the current piece is on the stage, with rehearsal on the 
rehearsal stage. Dimensions of the rehearsal room should be as 
per the main stage. Plan view of typical rehearsal stage for 
traditional theatre — @). Orchestra rehearsal rooms > @), choir 
rehearsal rooms ~ @), soloist rehearsal rooms and ballet rooms 
are needed in multipurpose theatres or opera houses. 


Experimental theatre 
Personnel and rehearsal rooms, workshops and stores are also 
required in reduced form for continuous operation. 


Technical utilities 

Transformer room, medium- and low-voltage switchroom, 
emergency power batteries, air-conditioning and ventilation 
plant, water supply (sprinkler system) according to local 
requirements and specialist planning. 


Public areas 

The classical Italian opera houses had only narrow access doors 
and stairs — there was no actual foyer — whereas the huge public 
areas of the Grand Opéra House in Paris were impressive. The 
theatre fire in Vienna, in 1881, resulted in fundamental changes. 
Self-contained emergency stairs, separate for each level, were 
now required for the audience. Such a requirement in principle 
still applies today. 

In the traditional theatre, the foyers are subdivided into the 
actual foyer, restaurant (buffet) and a smoking foyer. An area of 
foyer 0.8-2.0m2/spectator and 0.6-0.8m2/spectator, respectively, 
is realistic. The function of the foyer has changed today. It may be 
supplemented with displays, performances and other activities. 
Theatre performances must be taken into account during 
planning: room height, wall, ceiling and floor configuration. 


Cloakrooms 

Minimum: 4m per 100 visitors. Nowadays, cloakrooms often 
have lockers: 1 locker per 4 visitors. The foyer is also the waiting 
and queuing area. WCs are installed with respect to the foyer in 
the normal ratio (i.e. 1 WC/100 people: 1/3 men, 2/3 women): 
there must be at least one men’s and one ladies’ toilet. The 
entrance hall (lobby) contains the day and evening ticket offices, 
which should be opposite each other. 


External access and emergency routes 
These are needed in accordance with local requirements and 
will depend on the location: 

— prestigious location in an urban square 

— location in a park or on a main street 

— as part of a large building.

CINEMAS 


Before planning, bring in a cinema technology firm for 
advice. 

Film projection: Fire separation materials are no longer 

required for the projection room with safety film. 
Projectionists operate several projectors; the projection 
room is no longer a continuously used workplace for staff. 
1m of space behind the projector and at the Operating side, 
: 2.80m high, ventilation, noise insulation to the auditorium 
lengitudinalcéction ey side. Projection rooms may be combined for several 
a auditoriums. 
q first row of seats Film widths of 16mm, 35mm and 70mm. The centre of 
the projected beam should not deviate more than 5° 
horizontally or vertically from the centre of the screen, or it 
should be deflected via a deflection mirror. > (4) 

Conventional systems use two projectors in a 
superimposing operation. Nowadays, automatic Operation 
with only one projector using horizontal film plates 
provides no-break film presentations with 4000m spools. 
This system is sometimes used with several projection 
rooms and remote control from projection and control 
points. The film automatically gives control signals for all 
the functions of the projector, lens changes, auditorium 
lighting, stage lighting, curtain and picture cover. 

Picture sizes depend on the distance of the projector 
from the screen; height/side ratio is 1:2.34 (Cinemascope) or 
1:1.66 (wide screen) for smaller room widths. The angle 
from the middle of the last row of seats to the outer edge of 
the picture should be at most 38° for Cinemascope. The 
ratio of the spacing of the last row of seats to the projection 
screen should be 3:2 = @)-@). 

Projection screen: Minimum distance of projection 
screen from wall in the case of THX is 120cm, according to 
theatre size and system reducible to 50cm with respect to 
the sound system configuration. 

The projection screen is perforated (sound-permeable). 
Movable blinds or curtains limit the projection screen to the 
side for the same picture height. Large projection screens 
are curved with a radius centred on the last row of seats.

CINEMAS 


The floor gradient is achieved by an inclination of up to 10% 
or by the use of steps with a maximum step height of 16cm 
and with aisle widths of 1.20m. 


Acoustics 
Neighbouring auditoriums should be separated with 
partitioning walls of approximately 85dB 18—20000 Hz. 
Acoustic deflecting surfaces on the ceiling with low 
acoustic delay difference time. The reverberation time can 
increase with increasing room volume and decreases from 
0.8-0.2 seconds from low to high frequencies — p. 486 ©). 
The rear wall behind the last row of seats should be 
sound absorbent to prevent echo. 
The loudspeakers should be distributed around the 
auditorium so that the volume difference between the first 
and last row of seats does not exceed 4dB. 


Sound reproduction 
In future, apart from mono-optical sound reproduction, the 
Dolby stereo optical sound system in 4-channel technology 
is also necessary with three loudspeaker combinations 
behind the screen and the fourth channel with additional 
speakers to the side and rear. 

For 70mm film 6-channel magnetic sound, the additional 
speaker combination is behind the screen. 

In the case of BTX, there is a sound absorption wall 
behind the screen according to the Lucas Film System into 
which the loudspeaker combination is built. 

Ticket offices are now superseded by electronic booking 
and reservation systems. 

Multi-screen complexes are now considered necessary 
to be commercially viable. Various theories are used to 
determine the total seats needed. A basic requirement is to 
give visitors a choice of programmes and to enable the 
operator to show each film in an auditorium with a capacity 
to match anticipated public demand. Thus, a film playing to 
half capacity audiences can be transferred to smaller 
auditorium or vice versa. Seating capacity varies between 
100 and 600 chairs. 

In larger units, there are boxes for smokers and families 
with children which have fire-resistant and sound-insulating 
partition walls and special sound reproduction systems. 

Car parking space: normally one per 5-10 spectators. 
New larger cinemas with several projection rooms in 
combination with multi-level communications, leisure, 
sporting and shopping options provide entertainment for 
the whole family under one roof, and they can also be used 
for seminars and events. 

Can be located in peripheral areas of towns with 
corresponding car parking spaces, e.g. Kinopolis in 
Brussels with an amusement park, 27 projection rooms with 
7500 seats (150 and 700 per room) and screens from 12m x 
8m up to 29m x 10m = ©.

DRIVE-IN CINEMAS 


Drive-in cinema spectators do 
not leave their cars; they watch 
the film from their cars. 

The size is limited by ramps 
and the number of cars (max. 
1000-1300) which still permits a 
good view. Normal size is 
450-500 cars . (1).

Cars 


The location should be near to a 
motorway, petrol station or 
service area, and screened off so 
that light and noise from passing 
vehicles does not interfere. 

An entrance with a waiting 
area will avoid traffic congestion 
on the road. A drive-past ticket 
office allows tickets to be 
obtained from the cars: (1). 

Exiting is best done by leaving 
the ramp towards the front. 

Ramps are inclined in curves 
so that the front of each vehicle 
is raised providing even the rear- 
seat passengers with a good 
view of the screen over the roofs 
of the front row of cars - @. 

The design of the whole 
ground area should be dust-free 
and not slippery when wet. 

Ticket booths: one booth for 
300 vehicles, two for 600, three for 
800, and four for 1000 vehicles. 

The screen. size varies 
according to the number of 
vehicles, 14.50m x 11.30m for 
650 cars; 17.0m x13.0m for 950 
cars. The screen is best facing 
east or north since this permits 
earlier performances and _ in 
areas with harsh climates the 
screen should be housed in a 
structure with solid walls. 

The height above the 
ground depends on the ramp 
slope and angle of sight. A 
screen which is_ inclined 
towards the top reduces 
distortion. The framework and 
screen wall must be capable of 
withstanding the wind pressure. 

Rows of seats should be 
included and a_ children's 
playground is desirable. 

The projection building is 
usually centrally located at 
100m from the screen. The 
projection room contains film 
projector(s), generator and 
sound amplification system. 

Sound reproduction is best 
with loudspeakers inside the 
cars. These speakers (for two 
vehicles) are located on posts set 
5.0m apart and are taken into 
the car by the cinema visitors. 

Heating may be supplied on 
the loudspeaker posts with 
possible connections for internal 
car heating. 





SPORTS: STADIUMS 
General Layout 


The stadiums of antiquity have never been matched for grandeur (the 
Circus Maximus in Rome, for instance, could hold 180000 spectators) 
but they form the basis for modern sports stadiums. The size of the 
inner sports field can be based loosely on the size of a football pitch, 
with measurements of 70x 109m. For athletics stadiums there should 
be a running track surrounding the field (see page 500). The basic 
shape for the playing area is usually similar to the elliptical shape 
used in ancient stadiums. As a rule a stadium is partly below ground 
with the excavated earth heaped up around it. In relation to town 
planning, sports grounds must fit in well with the local topography 
and be designed with good transport links and supply facilities (train, 
bus and tram stations, large car parks etc.). They should not be sited 
close to industrial areas where smoke, odours and noise might create 


unpleasant conditions. Covered and open grounds for various sports 
can be combined and integrated into the town/district plan. 

The orientations of ancient arenas were determined by the 
variable timing of the contests —- axes ran west to east or south to 
north. In Europe today the main axis is usually north-east to south- 
west so that a maximum number of spectators have the sun at their 
backs — ©). Access gates are therefore situated to the east. The 
turnstiles are positioned so as to direct the stream of visitors to the 
various stadium entry points. Access into the stadium is often 
through the embankment formed from the excavated earth or via 
stairways leading halfway up the terraces to a point from which the 
rows above and below can be reached = (7).

To give spectators a clear view and ensure good acoustics, 

Vitruvius recommended a fixed gradient of 1:2 for both seating and 

standing areas. (If a public-address system is incorporated, then, of 
(2) USA: segmented layout habibi ase ie course, the view is the only determinant of the gradient.) 
semicircular ends : : Y g i 

In staggered seating rows, spectators in every row should be 


able to see over the heads of those in the corresponding two rows 
in front. This results in a parabolic curve. The best viewing 
conditions are to be found on the ‘long side’ of the segment. 

The arrival of spectators happens relatively slowly so the widths 
of entrances and stairways have to be calculated on the basis of the 
flow of spectators leaving the stadium. This is when the flow rate is 
at maximum. According to research in the Amsterdam stadium —> @), 
every 5000 spectators needs 7 minutes or 420 seconds to leave via 
the 9.5m wide steps. (In equivalent stadiums the times are: Los 
Angeles, 12 minutes; Turin, 9 minutes.) Therefore, one spectator uses 
1m of staircase width in 


9.5x420 =0.8 seconds 


Rotterdam: Budapest: 5000 
curved sides and corners horseshoe around long axis Or, in 1 second a 1m wide staircase accommodates 
5000 = 1.25 spectators 
9.5x 4.20 


The formula giving the staircase width necessary to allow a certain 
number of spectators to leave the stadium in a given time is: 


staircase width (m) = number of spectators 
emptying time (s) x 1.25 


First aid rooms for the spectators should be provided close to the 
spectator area. First aid treatment for 20000 or more spectators requires 
a suite of rooms: treatment and recovery rooms 15m2, storeroom 2m2 
and two toilets with ventilation. For sports grounds with 30000 capacity 
or greater, provide an additional room of 15m2 for the emergency 
services (police, fire brigade). Commentary boxes in the main stand 
must have a good view onto the field of play and each box should be at 
least 1.5m2. Behind every five press boxes a control room of 4m2 is 
necessary. One car parking space should be provided for every four 
spectators and spaces should be allocated for coaches and buses.

SPORTS: STADIUMS 


General Layout 


SPECTATOR FACILITIES 

All planning must be done in accordance with national ‘regulations 
for the construction and management of meeting places’, in which 
the requirements for access ways, stairways, ramps and spectator 
accommodation are set out. 

Depending upon the planned capacity, seating is provided either 
along the long side of the ground (to take advantage of the shortest 
viewing distance) or, for capacities above 10000, around the whole 
ground. As most events take place in the afternoon, the best position 
for spectators is on the west side so that the sun is at their backs. 

To improve viewing conditions in the multi-row layout, there has 
to be sufficient super-elevation. In smaller grounds with up to 20 rows 
of terracing or 10 rows of seats, a linear gradient of 1:2 can be taken 
as a basis. In all other grounds the linear gradient should ideally be 
replaced with one which is parabolic. In this case the gradient for 
seating and standing places is to be set using a construction based on 
the spectators’ line of sight. In terracing stands the super-elevation 
should be 12cm and in rows of seating it should be 15cm > 1). 


Seating Areas 
The necessary space for seating areas is calculated as follows: 


width of seat 0.5m 
overall depth 0.8m 
of which: 

seat depth 0.35m 
circulation 0.45m 


Rows of seats (benches) as well as single seats can be planned. 
Seats with back rests offer greater comfort. Depending on the 
arrangement of entrances and exits, each row can comprise: 

on each side of a passage 

in shallow rising rows 48 places 

in steeply rising rows 36 places 
Seating and standing areas must be separated by fences. For every 
750 seats an escape route (stairway, ramp, flat surface) with a 
minimum width of 1.00 m must be provided. 


Standing Areas 
The necessary space for standing spaces is calculated as follows: 
width of standing space 0.5m 

depth of standing space 0.4m 
Again, for every 750 spaces an escape route (stairway, ramp, flat 
surface) with a minimum width of 1.00m must be provided. To allow 
standing areas to fill and empty evenly, and to prevent dangerous 
overcrowding, they should be divided into groups or blocks of 
around 2500 places. Each block should have its own entry/exit points 
and should be separated from the others by fences. 

Inside the blocks of standing places, a staggered arrangement of 
crush barriers will be necessary to prevent diagonal crowd surges. It 
must also be ensured that there is a suitably strong barrier, with a 
height of around 1.10m, between every ten rows of standing spaces. 

The building industry produces pre-cast concrete steps for the 
construction of spectator areas + (8) + (0). 

Guests of honour: In larger stadiums an enclosed ‘Royal box’ with 
movable furniture may be needed. 

Roofing of stands: Covering as many places as possible should be 
the aim. By designing overlapping stands the number of covered 
seats can be increased.

central services or outside 
contractors (who transport 
their own equipment) are 
used, this space can be 
dispensed with. 

Stores for sports and 
maintenance equipment for 
adjacent outdoor facilities 
have to be included in the 
room programme of the 
sports hall if separate 
buildings are not provided. 
Allow 0.3m2 per 100m2

Stands for spectators can be fixed or movable > ()-(@). For 
small stands with up to 10 steps of seating, the gradient of the 
rows can be linear (height 0.28-0.32m). A parabolic slope 
should be planned for larger stands (height of eye level: 1.25m 
seated, 1.65m standing; height of sight-line: 0.15m seated, 
0.12m standing). The distance between rows of seating should 
be 0.80-0.85m — (2) + @) and for standing spaces 0.4-0.45 m. 
The point of reference for the sight-line is 0.5m above the 
playing area boundary marking. Spectator areas behind 
goals should be protected with mobile safety nets. 

Spectator stands can be accessed from above or below. 
Access from below is more cost-effective (saving on staircases 
and separate entrances) but has a disadvantage in that people 
arriving during an event will disturb the players and the 
spectators already present. Open sides need to have protective 
barriers at least 1m high, measured from the surface of the 
circulation area > (). 

The design of ceiling and wall areas adjacent to partitioning 
curtains should ensure that sound bridging is minimised when 
the curtain is in the lowered position > (6) - @). 

It is recommended that walkways either side of the changing 
and shower rooms are segregated into those for street shoes 
and those for sports shoes only. 

Showers have to be immediately accessible from the 
changing rooms and there needs to be a drying area in 
between. The shower rooms should be designed as two 
separable sections, both connected to the two neighbouring 
changing rooms in such a way that from each changing room 
either one or both sections can be accessed. 

The first aid room should be on the same level as the playing 
area and could be integrated with the instructors’/referees’ 
room, which should be near the changing rooms.

Arena type A 

These consist of an eight-lane 
running track around a central 
sports field. The field has 
areas for shot-putting, discus, 
hammer and javelin throwing. 
In the northern sector there is 
a water jump for’ the 
steeplechase; the high jump 
takes place in the southern 
sector. The pole-vaulting area 
is outside the running track, 
as are the pits for long and 
triple jumping. The former 
runs parallel to the easterly 
straight of the track while the 
latter are beside the straight 
to the west.

e Arena type B These consist of a six-lane 


running track around the 
interior field area. The layout is 
similar to type A arenas except 
that the pole vault, long jump 
and triple jump take place 
within the track, in the northern 
sector. However, these facilities 
can also be arranged outside of 
the running track.

Arena type C 

These consist of a four-lane 
running track around a sports 
field. Areas for the discus, 
hammer and javelin are in the 
southern sector within the 
track, as is the high jump. The 
run-ups for pole-vaulting, long 
jump and triple jump are in the 
northerly segment, which also 
has an area for the shot put.

Arena type D 

These consist of the following 

separate facilities > (1): 
four- to six-lane_ sprint/ 
hurdles track; 
playing field 68 x 105m 
(70 x 109m with safety 
zones); 
shot put training area, 
throwing south; 
multipurpose area for long/ 
triple jump, run-up west; 


high-jump area, run-up 
north; 
shot-putting ring, throwing 
north; 


javelin/ball throwing area, 

throwing north. 

Generally the running track 
surface in type D arenas is 
earth and cinders, but for very 
high usage it ts advisable to 
use a synthetic finish. 

Large combined playing 
fields include a_ straight 
running track and facilities for 
high/long/triple jump and 
shot-putting both next to and 
on the main playing field. 

For training in field sports it 
is advisable for safety reasons 
to provide a ‘throwing field’. 
This is simply a grassed target 
area of approximately the 
same size as an arena playing 
field > @).

ATHLETICS FACILITIES 


In the table > @Q), cited measurements correspond to the 
competition regulations and are to be strictly observed. 
Non-compliance is permitted in facilities for school sport, 
training and leisure. 

The same facilities can be used for both hammer and 
discus throwing —> @) -@) although the diameter of the 
throwing circle must be adjusted accordingly. Protective 
barriers > (1) — @) are necessary only in competition events. 
Simpler constructions, such as netting or a protective grille, 
can be used for discus at other times > @). 

Javelin throwing facilities require a 4m wide run-up 
track generally 36.5m, but at least 30m, in length and a 
landing area >~ @. The end of the run-up track is 
permanently marked with a curved delivery line (arc). 

For the shot put, a throwing circle and throwing sector 
are required + (6) - ©. The overall length required is

height of surround netting 4.00 m 


Use 2.5 mm thick wire net, with a 4cm mesh width, for 
surround netting. 

The number of active tennis players at present is 
between 1.6% and 3% of the total population. Use a 1:30 
court:player ratio as a rule of thumb for the calculation of 
the number of courts needed in new developments. 


necessary courts (T) = population x 3 


100 x 30 


The area needed for tennis courts in children’s facilities is 
between 120 and 153m? > @). 

For recreational tennis courts (i.e. where there are no 
spectators) four car parking spaces should be provided per 
court. 

To calculate the size of plot required, add the net areas 
(‘usable sports areas’) needed for the planned number of 
tennis courts, training walls and children’s facilities. To this 
add an additional 60-80% of the total net area to give the 
overall plot size. 

Outdoor courts should, as near as possible, be 
orientated in the north-south direction. It is recommended 
that no more than two courts should be immediately next to 
one another and if they are behind each other a sight screen 
must be used to separate them. Artificial lighting should be 
at least 10m high and along the sides of the court. 

The layout should be designed so as to allow adaptation 
to meet future needs and planned so that any future 
building activity can take place without interrupting the 
playing activities. Potential future needs _ for 


accommodation (groundsman, trainer, tenant) and garages 
should be anticipated in the plans from the beginning. 
Tennis courts should not be ‘foreign bodies’ in the 
environment: they should fit in with their surroundings.

centres, it is possible to play tennis with hall heights as low 

as 7m. The applicable height of a hall is measured at the net

Halls may be permanent —(5)-@), demountable or 
6b = 300 multipurpose. Based on the court and_ run-out 


measurements prescribed in the international regulations 
for competition-standard facilities, one court requires a hall 
size of 18.30m x 36.60m. Therefore, use the following hall 
areas: 

two courts = (2 x 18.30) x (1 x 36.60) = 36.60 x 36.60 

three courts = (3 x 18.30) x (1 x 36.60) = 54.90 x 36.60 
These dimensions make the facilities suitable for both 
leisure and competition use. The possible uses are: 

1. courts are competition-level ‘singles’ 

2. courts are competition-level ‘doubles’ 

3. courts are for training/leisure use, singles and/or doubles

MINIATURE GOLF 


A lane-golf course consists of 18 clearly separated lanes 
(with the exception of ‘long shot’) which have to be 
numbered and to accord with the relevant regulations. A 
course appropriate for tournaments comprises: 


lane separations (mostly ribbons or tapes) 
tee markings 

one or more hazards (can be omitted) 
borderline (can be omitted) 

setting-down markings (can be omitted) 
hole 


Further specified details may need to be considered. 

The lane playing area must have a minimum width of 
80cm and has to be at least 5.50m long. Lanes designed for 
level playing must be completely flat, with a surface quality 
sufficient to guarantee a predictable path of travel of the 
balls. If lanes are not separated by fixed ribbons or tapes, 
they have to be marked in some other way (except long 
shot). Each lane has to have a tee marking and all markings 
should be standardised throughout the course (i.e. a 
specific system for all lanes). Hazards are usually fixed in 
position although, depending on their intended purpose 
and design, it is acceptable for some to be moveable. Those 
which are not fixed should be marked. All hazards must be 
robust in design and construction.

MINIATURE GOLF 


Each hazard has to be different from others on the same 
course, not just visually but also technically, and it should 
be possible for players to predict the effect it will have on 
the path of the ball. 

The borderline marks the end of the first hazards. In 
lanes without built-in hazards, they show the minimum 
distance the ball has to travel to remain in the game. If the 
first hazard is the full width of the lane the borderline 
coincides with the end of the hazard. 

Lanes that are only playable from the tee do not have a 
borderline. 

Borderline markings have to be installed in such a way 
that the edge that marks the tee matches the end of hazard 
marking. 

The setting-down markings indicate where a play-off or 
movement of the ball is allowed during the game. The 
markings show where the ball should be placed. 

It must be possible to reach the target from the tee 
marking in one hit. Should the target be a hole, the diameter 
should not exceed 120mm. For minigolf or star golf 100 mm 
is the limit. 

The game does not require any special equipment: 
normal golf clubs, balls and accessories are permitted. 
However, the striking area of the club is not allowed to be 
more than 40cm2. All lane-golf and normal golf balls are 
permissible provided the diameter is between 37 mm and 
43mm. Balls made of wood, metal, glass, fibreglass, 
ivory or other materials are not accepted as lane-golf 
balls. 

Miniature golf lanes are usually designed with the 
following standard sizes: lane length, 6.25m; lane width, 
0.90 m; diameter of end circle 1.40m. 


Minigolf 

Developed at the beginning of the 50s, these courses 
consist of 17 concrete pistes (12m long) and a long-range 
piste (approximate length, 25m). The concrete pistes are set 
in a frame made from steel pipes and the hazards are made 
from natural stone. 


Cobi Golf 
This is one of the most difficult lane systems of golf to play. 
The special characteristics of Cobi golf are the small ‘gates’ 
placed in front of the hazards. 

The courses again consist of 18 lanes but they can be in 
large format (12 to 14m long) as well as in small format 
(length 6 to 7m). 


Stargolf 
A stargolf course consists of 18 lanes with concrete pistes. 
The first 17 of these have a circular target area, but on the 
last lane the hole is in a star-shaped target area, hence the 
name of the system. The length of the lanes is 8m; the 
width is 1m; the diameter of the end circles is 2m. 

The concrete lanes are enclosed in pipe barriers. The tee 
marker is a circle with a diameter of 30cm. The holes have 
a diameter of 10cm. 


In all miniature golf systems with lanes, the hazards are 
standardised and constructed according to the criteria 
dictated by the sport. The aim is to make it possible to play 
each lane of the course with a single stroke. With all holes 
being par 1, the golfers’ ultimate goal is to complete the 
course with a total score of 18.

GOLF COURSES 


Golf courses are best situated in undulating terrain with 
gentle gradients, or in dunes if the site is on the coast. 
Ideally, the course should be surrounded by forest or light 
tree cover and have natural hazards (e.g. streams, lakes, 
etc.). The size of the course depends on the number of 
‘holes’ and their length (i.e. the distance from tee to hole). 
Golf courses cannot be treated in the same way as other 
‘regulated’ and standardised sports facilities. 

Nowadays golf courses can be constructed almost only 
in rural areas, especially in areas previously used for 
farming or forestry. The planning of a golf course requires 
the direction of a widely experienced specialist who needs 
the knowledge of a landscape architect, golf player, 
landscape ecologist, soil scientist, agronomist, economist 
etc. Before any planning can commence, a detailed site 
investigation has to take place. 

When considering a new course, a population of 
approximately 100000 within an area less than 30 minutes 
away by car is needed for a nine hole course. This should 
ensure that membership will reach the necessary number 
for a viable golf club (around 300 members). 

An important part of each golf course is the practice 
area, which comprises a driving range, a practice green and 
an approach green + (@). The driving range should be as 
even as possible and have a width of 80m in order to allow 
15 golfers to practice at once. The length should be at least 
200m, or 225m ideally, and should be arranged in such a 
way that neighbouring holes are not disturbed. The 
approach green should have a size of at least 300m2. Sand 
hazards (bunkers) for practice shots should cover at least 
200m? and should be of various depths. The best place for 
the practice area is next to the club house. 

The plan for a golf course should generally be based on 
the eventual provision of an 18 hole course, so an area of at 
least 55ha, preferably 60ha, should be available in the long 
term. To make it possible to play half a round (nine holes) 
on an 18 hole golf course, the first tee and the ninth green 
as well as the tenth tee and the eighteenth green should be 
as near the clubhouse as possible — (6).

GOLF COURSES 


Practice areas can provide training either just for the 
short/approach game or offer instruction in all aspects of 
the game of golf. It is possible to establish independent golf 
centre in an area of 10ha, or perhaps less. The centre 
should contain a driving range, an approach green, a 
practice green and a nine hole course (par 3) > (1). 

The table below shows the lengths of the holes in 
relation to the par rating.

Recognised standard lengths for golf courses range 
between standard 60 at a normal length of 3749m and 
standard 74 at a normal length of 6492m. 


Elements of a golf course 

At the start of each hole is the tee, which is not fixed in size 
but with sufficient width it should measure approximately 
200 m2. Fairways have a width of 30-50 m and vary in length 
from 100m to up to more than 500m. At the end of the 
fairway is the green, which should be at least 400 m2 and is 
normally 500-600m2. ‘Approach greens’ are not found 
everywhere but where they are 
included they have a minimum 
width of 2.5m. Rough areas 
with long grass and 
shrubs/trees border the 

edge of the course.

Example of a motorboat harbour 


SAILING: HARBOURS/MARINAS 


The direction of the prevailing wind and waves is an important 
consideration in determining the position of the harbour 
entrance and also influences the the design of the breakwaters, 
which protect the interior of the harbour from waves > (1) - @). 
Entrances and exits have to be at least equal in width to the 
length of the mooring spaces for sailing boats or, preferably, 
one and a half times the maximum boat length. 

It should be remembered that boats under sail will approach 
the harbour entrance from a variety of directions, depending on 
the prevailing wind on the day. Consequently, the harbour 
should have a turning area, with a diameter of 35-60m, behind 
the entrance. 

The construction of breakwaters, sea defences and landing 
stages, and the means of transport and storage for boats, have 
a fundamental influence on the type of use that can be made of 
the harbour or marina in different climatic conditions. 

As well as offering protection from waves, breakwaters (also 
called moles) also prevent the harbour from filling up with silt 
carried by the sea currents. Stone breakwaters are built either 
from natural stone boulders or pre-cast concrete units in 
geometrical shapes (e.g. tetrahedron) that interconnect with 
each other when laid. As well as stone breakwaters, sheet-pile 
walls are also commonly used. These are made from framed 
steel sections and have a life expectancy of 20-30 years. 

Each boat needs a berth appropriate to its use (e.g. training, 
weekend, holiday etc.). The options include water berths, land 
berths or hall/indoor berths and the areas required for boats 
and associated facilities are: water berths 90-160m2; land 
berths 100-200m2. This gives a total area per boat of 
approximately 200-360 m2. In addition, at least one family car 
parking space should be planned for every berth. 

In choosing the layout of berths it may be necessary to 
consider the frequency and shape of ice formation. There may 
be a risk of damage through the expansion and thrust of pack- 
ice. 

Floating pontoons of steel, reinforced concrete, inflated 
tubes and floating styrofoam pieces are used both as 
breakwaters and landing stages. Steel and reinforced concrete 
pontoons, which sink about 2m, adapt to the particular water 
level and give the necessary calming of the water. Caissons are 
prefabricated reinforced concrete units which are sunk and 
filled with sand or gravel once in position. — Page 512.

ROWING 


Competition rowing boats are mostly team boats and 
usually belong to clubs situated on waterways that are 
flowing and obstacle-free, in pleasant natural settings. Such 
clubs may also use kayaks and Canadian canoes. 

Boathouses with windows or roof-lights should be north 
facing to keep the sun out. The doors need to be at least 
2.50 x 2.75 m to allow crews to carry in the boats held above 
their heads. The hall should have a width of at least 6.00m 
and a length of 30m or more. The height, if possible, should 
be 4.0 m -> (14. Note that oars are 3.80m long, with a blade 
width of 15-18cm. They should be stored near the entrance, 
either horizontally on shelves or, preferably, suspended 
from pulleys above a pit (depending on the height of the 
hall). Between the boathouse and the landing stage, an area 
of bank with a width of 20-30m is necessary for cleaning 
and preparing boats. A water pump and parking/storage 
space for boat trailers is also needed. 

Single or double sided skulling pools for training with 
short oars > (6) might be required. For a full eight, a pool 
size of 12.60 x 7.60m is necessary. The water circulation 
creates current conditions that are similar to open water. 

Other facilities to consider in addition to changing rooms 
include a gymnasium and swimming pool.

WATER SPORTS 


Slalom courses can _ be 
established in natural 
settings or in_ artificial 
purpose-built facilities (e.g. 
the international regatta 
course in Munich -> (5)). 
Natural courses require 
: : traffic-free stretches of river 
start COMtro! trap_| Seeminns 350m with a suitable gradient 
IB (1:100 or more) and flow 
rate, which may be natural 
or controlled by a weir 
control trap upstream. If they are free of 
waterfall 0.8m obstacles and at least 8m 
wide, mill or power station 
outflows can also_ be 
Suitable. Artificial facilities 
are constructed from 
Suitably inclined reinforced 
concrete channels” with 
concrete stone obstacles. 
Consideration must be 
given to the installation of 
up to 32 gates (3) for 
regattas.

RIDING FACILITIES 


Riding facilities/stables should, if possible, be in the 
immediate vicinity of land suitable for riding. Areas with 
high ground and air humidity, as are often found in 
valleys, should be avoided, as should windless locations, 
where providing the desired ventilation may be difficult. 
Ideal sites are in hilly and windy areas. However, slope 
gradients for buildings and riding arenas should be less 
than 10%. 

Saddle rooms, as far as possible, should be long and 
rectangular, with a large wall space and a width of 
4.0-4.5m. Saddles can be hung in rows staggered above 
each other (8). Saddle rooms and grooming rooms 
should have heating and be well ventilated. 

In riding arenas the minimum headroom for show 
jumping and horseback acrobatics is 4.00m > 6) + ©. 

No universal rule can be applied to the space allocated 
to spectators. In general, though, spectators should not 
look down too steeply on the horses. An effective solution 
can be to use a spectator gallery — 43), with the first row 
for seating and the second for standing. Behind this is 
room for two rows of circulating people. This arrangement 
will create 200 seated and standing places in a 20 x 40m 
arena. The size of the main entrance has to be large 
enough to allow access for medium sized lorries (3.00m 
wide, 3.80 high). Side entrances should be 1.20m or more 
wide and a minimum of 2.80m high. Doors have to open 
outwards. 

Glass windows above the riding arena floor should be 
protected by a fine mesh grille. 

An arena riding area of approximately 1000m2 is 
sufficient for ten horses.

example: 
according to terrain, the following data apply to L, and H/N: 
for example, H/N = 0.534, c = 35°, K = 87m; 


in the table you will find L = 87 for Vo = 26, and c = 35°, E=90m, U = 14, T = 5.7 at

(3) Measurements 


The judges’ towers should be arranged in a stepped 
formation parallel to the line from the edge of the launch 
platform to the end of the landing run curve. Each tower 
should be skewed by 7° to 10° from the centre-line of the 
landing run so that the judges can observe the whole flight 
and the landing clearly. The parapet of the towers should be 
1 to 1.20m above the floor level. 

In the run-up, aS many starting positions as possible 
should be evenly distributed on a length E/5. Along this 
distance is a vertical fall of approximately 1m. The lowest 
starting position is at E - E/5. 

Note that the minimum width of the landing track at 
K=L,/7 + 4m. 


General comments 

All gradients are given in old divisions based on 360 
degrees. Should the transition be parabolic, then R,, Ry and 
R3 are the smallest radii of these parabolas. 

With natural run-ups the most frequently used areas 
need to be marked at 2m intervals in order to simplify the 
exact fixing of the starting position. The gradient of the 
launch platform as well as several points along the run-up 
curve should be indicated permanently on both sides with 
fixed built-in profiles so that even non-specialists can re- 
create the exact profile when preparing the ski jump. 

It is recommended that profile markers are also installed 
alongside the landing track up to the run-out. This enables 
the snow profile to be established precisely, especially 
when the snow cover is deep. 

As a rule, ski jumps with L greater than 50m should not 
be built with a V, of less than 21m/s. Note that ski jumps 
with L above 90m are not approved by the FIS.

ju roller skating rinks and other large flat 
spaces. A surrounding embankment 
or barrier approximately 100-150 mm 
high is needed and there must be 
suitable drainage for water run-off. 
Water is sprayed on to the surface to 
a depth of 20mm. 

In warm climates or for year-round 
use, artificial ice rinks are the 
solution. These consist of a cooling 
pipe system in a screed floor through 
which a deep frozen salt solution or 
cold air (usually a compressed 
ammonia system) is pumped. The 
pipes are roughly 25mm below the 
screed surface. > (@) + ©)

Standard race track: The track length 
is usually 400m (although some can 
be 300m or 333.5m) and should be 
have two lanes +(@). The distance 
through the curves is measured 500 
mm from the edge of the inside of the 


track. This gives the race distance of 

(2 x 111.94) + (25.5 x 3.1416) + (35.5 x

Bobsleigh and toboggan runs:

ICE RINKS 


Curling: There are several types of curling 
and the lengths and widths of the track 
vary accordingly > (1) - @). See also ©) on 
page 496/497. In German curling the 
pitching and target areas require a low 
frame, which can easily be stepped over, 
on three sides. The track in Scottish curling 
is 42m long, with 38.35m between the 
target centres but this can be shortened to 
29.26m if the ice is in bad condition. 


Ice hockey: The pitch area is 30 x 60 m and 
it has curved corners. The goals are 1.83m 
wide, 1.22m high, and are positioned such 
that players can skate around the back of 
them. The pitch needs to be fully 
surrounded by a wood or plastic barrier 
1.15-1.22m high —> @). 


Figure skating: A rectangular ice rink 
between 56 x 26m and 60 x 30m in size is 
suitable for both figure skating and in-line 
skating, which is becoming increasingly 
popular. It is possible to create a 
multipurpose rink: roller skating from 
March to November and ice skating from 
December to February. This requires a 
cooling pipe system 25-50mm below the 
rink surface (note that this is not possible 
in terrazzo) + ©). 


ROLLER SKATING RINKS 


(1) Sports rinks 
Roller hockey 15 x 30 to 20 x 40m 
Figure roller skating 25 x 50m 
(2) Leisure rinks 10 x 10 to 20 x 20m 


An impact board 250mm high, 30mm 
above the rink surface, and an 800mm solid 
barrier are required on all sides of the rink. 
Behind the short edges a 2m high wire 
netting fence should be installed to catch 
stray balls. The rink should also have a 
surrounding walkway 1.2m wide and a 
channel to collect and disperse surface 
water. The gradient of the rink surface 
should not be greater than 0.2%. 


Construction 

(1) Fibre reinforced cement sheets, 15mm 
thick, laid on squared timber or on 
sand bedding. 

(2) Concrete tracks, 100-150mm depending 
on condition of subsoil, if possible 
jointless; if necessary cut in false joints 
2-3mm wide, space joints every

CYCLECROSS/BMX 


The minimum size of plot that can be used for BMX riding 
is 50 x 60 m whereas a large-scale competition track with 
ample space for spectators requires roughly 100 x 200 m. 
Depending on local conditions four varieties of BMX tracks 
are possible: 


(1) C-track: length 200m; 5m wide starting hill with four 
start positions. 

(2) B-track: length 250m; 7m wide starting hill with six start 
positions; minimum completion time 30 seconds. 

(3) A-track/national: minimum length between 270m and 
320m; 9m wide starting hill with eight start positions; 
minimum completion time 35 seconds. 

(4) A-track/international: minimum length 300m; 9m wide 
starting hill with eight start positions; minimum 
completion time 35 seconds. 


The track can contain any types of curves and jumps, and 
in any order. For safety, solid materials (i.e. stone, 
concrete or wood) should not be used to mark the edge of 
the track; car tyres or straw bales are sufficient. Solid 
borders and barriers for the spectator areas should be a 
minimum of 1m from the track. The length and gradient of 
downhill sections of the track should be such that the 
maximum attainable speed is 40km/h and the overall 
completion time has to be within capabilities of an 
average rider of 15 years of age.

SHOOTING RANGES 


Open shooting ranges should, if possible, be located in 
gulleys in forested areas, with the slope acting as a natural 
bullet trap. They must be well away from paths and areas 
open to the public. Indoor shooting ranges, which can be 
part of multipurpose sports facilities, provide a venue for 
air-rifle, pistol and small-bore rifle shooting >) - ©). 

In the UK, rifle and pistol ranges (but not air gun ranges) 
require not only planning permission and building 
regulation approval, but also the approval and safety 
certificate issued by the Ministry of Defence. 

To gain the necessary approval from the National Small- 
Bore Rifle Association (NSRA) or the National Rifle 
Association (NRA), consultation should be made at the 
earliest stage of design. The local Environmental Health 
Department and the Health and Safety Executive ought to 
be consulted on current methods of combating lead 
pollution. 

Safety devices like overhead and side baffles, safety 
walls and embankments must be built with approved 
building materials and certified by a specialist. 

Objections by ‘neighbours’ concerned about noise are 
generally upheld. 


Types of sport shooting 


(Olympic competitions: x = for men, xx = for women and

SHOOTING RANGES 


A shooting range has to arranged in such a way that it 
eliminates danger to people on the inside, i.e. those 
people who are shooting, as well as those in the 
surrounding area. Safety barriers are constructed to 
protect all directions within the overall potential firing 
spread. It has been found that for air and CO, guns, 
barriers must offer protection up to an angle of 20 
degrees upwards from the firing point. For rifles and hand 
guns this angle is 30 degrees —> (5). 

Demands made by local regulations concerning the 
effects of air pollution, noise, noxious substances, 
radiation etc. also have to be fully satisfied. 

For crossbow and archery ranges different regulations 
are in force. Areas adjacent to the line of fire need to be 
shielded through suitable safety constructions such as 
high baffles, walls or earth embankments along the sides 
and at the end of the range. 

An assessment of the suitability of the chosen plot for 
the building of a shooting range is fundamental to the 
calculation of the projects costs. A shooting range 
specialist should always be consulted to provide the 
planner with the necessary specialist knowledge. Specific 
considerations are: distance to existing or planned 
building areas and to inhabited houses; planned shooting 
direction; soil conditions; supply arrangements and waste 
disposal facilities; situation in relation to road and rail 
links (including future developments), and parking 
spaces. 

It is also important to assess whether it is possible or 
necessary to deviate from local guidelines. The control 
of noise pollution is a legal necessity and must be 
planned from the beginning. For open ranges, in 
particular, allowance should be made for additional 
noise reduction measures. These can be built-in in 
separate building phases. Approval and permission 
procedures are determined by national and _ local 
regulations. 

The design and size of a shooting range should 
facilitate the economic construction of any necessary 
future additions and extension.

Wrestling 

The basic mat size for competitions is 5 x 5m; for German 
championships and international competitions it is 6 x 6m 
Or greater, preferably 8x8m; and for international 
championships and the olympic games the size should be 
8 x 8m. The middle of mat needs to be marked with a 1m 
diameter ring with 100 mm wide edge strip. The thickness of 
the mat is 100mm and it has a soft covering. A protective 
edge strip, if possible, should be 2m wide; otherwise, 
bordering barriers with a slope of 45 degrees can be used. 
A 1.2m width of the protective strip should be equal in 
thickness to the mat and differentiated by use of colour. The 
protective strips in national bouts are 1m wide. 

If the mat is on a platform the height should be no 
greater than 1.1m. There are no corner pillars or ropes. 
Weight-lifting 

The lifting area should be no smaller than 4 x 4m and on 
a strong wooden base, with markings in chalk. The floor must 
not be sprung because weight-lifters require a solid footing. 

The largest diameter of weight plate is generally 
450mm. The weight of plates for one-handed exercises 
range up to 15kg; for two-handed exercises, the plates are 
up to 20kg in weight. 

Judo 

The contest area ranges from 6 x 6m up to 10 x 10m or 
6 x 12m and is covered with soft springy mat. Upholstered 
mats are not permitted. For international championship 
competitions, the contest area can be more than 10 x 10m. 

Ideally, the mat should be raised about 15cm. The 
boundary between the contest area and the border has to 
be clearly visible > (@).

INDOOR SPORTS 


Boxing 

The dimensions of boxing rings are set out in international 
regulations, and range from 4.9 x 4.9m up to 6.10 x 6.10m, 
although 5.5 x 5.5m is the size most commonly used. Rings 
are frequently raised on a podium that is 1 m wider on each 
side than the ring, giving a total area of between 7.5 x 7.5m 
and8x8m-—>@). 


Badminton 

The standard size is that of a doubles court, although a 
singles court can be used where space is severely 
restricted. Outside the court area —+ (4) the appropriate 
measurements are: 


safety strip (sides) 1.25m 
safety strip (front and rear) 2.5m 


side-to-side distance between courts >0.3m 
ene-to-end distance between courts > 1.3m 
between court and walls >1.5m 


Spectators must always be accommodated behind the 
safety strip. For international competitions, the 
minimum hall height is 8m, with at least 6m over the 
back line of the court. The height of the net at the posts 
is 1.55m and is 1.525m in the middle. The depth of the 
net is 760mm. The floor should be lightly sprung. The 
hall, if possible, should have no windows, the court 
being lit by roof lights, which should not be dazzling (i.e. 
300 lux or less).

Common billiards table dimensions 


INDOOR SPORTS 


Squash 
Normal construction is used for the building of squash 
courts. Solid walls of precast concrete units or prefabricated 
panelled timber framed construction are finished with 
special white plaster. To improve the view for spectators it 
is advantageous to use transparent material for the back 
wall. The dimensions of the court are: 

area 9.75 x 6.40m 

height 6.00m 
The floor needs to be slightly springy and have good 
surface grip. It is made of light coloured wood (maple or 
beech) boards running parallel to the side walls. 
Appropriate grade tongue-and-groove boards 25mm thick 
and with a sealing coat should be used. 

Across the foot of the front wall runs a strip (the ‘tin’) 
made of 2.5mm thick sheet of metal or metal covered 
plywood painted white. 


Table tennis 
At championship level, table tennis is played only in halls. 
The table itself is matt green with white border lines and 
has the following dimensions: 

area 1525 x 2740mm 

height 760mm 

thickness of table top > 25mm 
The tops of tables used in the open should be made of 
20mm thick cement fibre board. The hardness of the table 
surface needs to be such that a normal table tennis ball will 
bounce approximately 230 mm when dropped from a height 
of 300mm. A net with the following dimensions runs across 
the middle of the table: 

length 1830 mm 

height (over whole length) 152mm 
The playing area is cordoned off with 600-650mm high 
canvas screens. The size is generally no less than 6 x 12m, 
and 7 x 14m for international competition. The spectators 
are seated beyond the screen. > @) 


Billiards 

Requirements for billiard rooms depend on the various 
billiard table sizes involved (8). For normal private 
purposes, sizes IV, V and VI are used; in bars and clubs, 
sizes IV and V are most common, while in billiard halls sizes 
1, ll and Ul will be required. 

Billiard halls are usually on upper floors or in a bright 
basement, rarely on the ground floor. Where there is more 
than one table the distance between them should be at least 
1.70m for sizes | and Il and 1.60m or more for sizes Ill to V. 
The distance from walls should, if possible, be slightly 
more. A clear playing space is required all around the table 
and, if matches are to be televised, extra space must be 
provided for cameras. 

A clear wall space is needed for cue-holders 
(1.50 x 0.75m for 12 cues), score boards and rule sheets. 

The smallest possible light fittings should be used to 
give full and even lighting of the playing surface. The 
normal height of the light above the table is 800mm. 

In the UK the Billiards and Snooker Control Council 
(B&SCC) introduced (with world agreement) the ‘B&SCC 
3.50m standard table’ and for the first time the actual 
playing area size (3.50 x 1.75m) was specified within the 
cushion faces instead of the overall table size. However, 
these metric recommendations are still not often utilised, 
even in major competitions.

SKITTLE AND BOWLING ALLEYS 


Skittle and bowling alleys can be divided into the 

following areas: 

(1) The run-up, in which the ball is bowled after a few 
approach steps; 

(2) The lane, the surface along which the ball rolls; 

(3) The catching pit, in which the fallen skittles/pins and 
balls are collected. (It is also where skittles/pins can 
be stored.)

Normal arrangement of 
skittle area 


An asphalt alley puts the highest demands on the skittle 
players. The lane is 19.50m long and the width is 1.50m 
(with side boundary batten) or 1.34m (with side boundary 
channels). The lane surface is made from asphalt or plastic. 
9~O-@ 

An important feature of some alternative wooden (or 
plastic) skittle alleys is the gradient of the lanes. From the 
edge of the run-up to the front pin of the skittle stand, a 
distance of 23.50m, the lane rises through 100mm. - ©) 

The scissor skittle alley also has wooden (or plastic) 
lanes. The lanes are 0.35m wide until 9.5m beyond the end 
of the run-up, after which they widen up to 1.25m at the 
mid-point of the skittles. > 6)

(12) Two-lane bowling alley 





In bowling alleys — @2 the run-up area is made from cleanly 
sanded parquet and the lanes are of polished or varnished 
parquet. In contrast to skittles the pins are arranged in a 
triangular formation and there are ten of them. 

Bowling balls are 21.8cm in diameter and have a range 
of weights up to 7257g. They have three finger holes. For 
asphalt and scissor alleys, the balls have a diameter of 
16cm and weigh 2800-2900g. Other balls in use are 16.5 cm 
in diameter, with weights between 3050g and 3150g. Most 
modern balls are made of a composite plastic mixture. 
Skittles are usually made from hardwood (white 
beechwood); pins are also made of wood but are covered 
with plastic. All pins and skittles have standardised 
dimensions.

INDOOR SWIMMING POOLS 


Reference figures for estimating the required size of 
indoor swimming pools must take into account the 
demands made by the residents, schools and the sports 
clubs within the catchment area. As a rough guide, a pool 
area per inhabitant of between 0.025m2 (low population 
density) and 0.01m2 (high population density) may be 
used. > Q) 


Plot sizes (without car parks) 

When estimating the plot size required for an indoor 
swimming pool, 6-10 m2 (excluding car parking; see below) 
should be allowed per square metre of planned pool area. 
The larger the pool area, the smaller the figure that will be 
sufficient. If an additional outdoor space (patios, sundecks, 
garden areas) is planned add 10-20% to the calculated plot 
size. 

Flat and gently sloping (up to 15 degrees) sites simplify 
the planning of indoor pools on one level, a prerequisite for 
economically and functionally optimal design. Steeply 
sloping sites are usually associated with higher building 
costs and operational disadvantages. 


Parking 
The parking space to allow for each car is 25m2, and one 
space should be planned for every 5-10 changing room 
lockers in the pool complex. If spectator facilities are 
included, one additional car parking space per 10-15 
spectator places should be added. 

Bicycle parking spaces should be planned according to 
local needs, using an allowance of approximately 1.8 m2 per 
bicycle. 


Planning basics 

A provision analysis should be done to determine whether 
additional sport and leisure facilities are to be included in 
the design. Using a needs analysis the types of use and total 
water area are determined in relation to the catchment area. 
The location should be chosen to give the best possible 
access.

changing rooms. Allow a bathing time of 1.50 hours, except 
for peak periods. 

For the purposes of estimation, the following figures can 
be used: locker spaces 0.6-0.8 of the standard unit value; 
number of changing spaces 0.15-0.2 of the standard unit 
value, of which 0.6-0.08 of the standard unit value are 
changing cubicles. 

Of the changing cubicles available, 10% should be for 
families and disabled people. The ratio of cubicles to 
clothes lockers should be 1:4. 

In a communal changing room at least 30 lockers are 
necessary and there should be no less than 7.50m length of 
bench. The ratio of changing room spaces to lockers ranges 
up to 1:8. In holiday resorts it can become necessary to 
double the amount of locker spaces. 

Other facilities per standard unit value are: hairstyling 
spaces with hairdryers 0.03, foot disinfection baths 0.015 
and basins 0.015. A cleaning materials room of 1-2m2 
must be planned within the changing room area. All rooms 
need a minimum clear height of 2.50m. The minimum size 
of foot disinfection bath should be 0.75m wide, 0.50m 
deep. 

In the changing room area, for built-in cubicles, the 
following minimum dimensions are valid: overall 
measurements 1.00m wide, 1.25m deep, 2.00m high. 
Cubicles for families should be at least 1.50m wide, 
1.25m deep, 2.00m high. >() Changing rooms for 
wheelchair users need overall measurements of 2.00m 
wide, 1.00m deep, 2.00m high, and a clear door width of 
0.8m.

INDOOR SWIMMING POOLS 


Diving pits are usually equipped with two kinds of diving-off 
point: rigid platforms, which must be level, (1, 3, 5, and 
10 m high) and springboards (1 and 3m high). The heights 
are measured from the water surface. Springboards are 
made of aluminium, wood or plastic. Both platforms and 
springboards must have non-slip surfaces. Ladders are 
usually used to reach platforms and boards, although lifts 
should be considered for large competition facilities. All 
boards and platforms are situated at one side of the pool 
—+()-@). To allow divers to see the water surface better, 
water surface agitators or sprinklers are used.

OPEN AIR SWIMMING POOLS 


Open air pools are used almost exclusively for leisure 
activities. The required water area per inhabitant ranges 
from 0.15m2 in low population density catchment areas to 
0.05m? where the population density is high. This 
relationship between the number of inhabitants and the size 
of the water area ignores any element of tourism. 

A site area of 8-16m2 per square metre of the planned 
water area should be planned. Allow parking space for one 
car and two bicycles for every 200-300 m2 of the site area. 

For the entry area, 200m2 should be allocated per 
1000 m? water area, of which 50m2 will be for a covered 
entrance with a ticket office and some form of entry control. 

An area of 10m? should be planned for staff rooms in 
facilities with water areas up to 2000mz2; above this, 20m2 
should be allowed for staff.

(6) Planning units for open air pools (example) 








INDOOR/OPEN AIR SWIMMING POOLS 
General Planning Principles 


Large complexes that combine indoor and open air swimming 
pools, depending on the type of design, offer more flexibility 
than separate facilities and are ideal centres for family leisure 
activities. However, the limitations imposed by the local 
seasonal weather patterns necessitate careful consideration of 
the allocation of indoor and outdoor water areas. The design 
must differentiate between the type of use during summer and 
winter times, as well as the transition periods in between. 
The following types of use can be considered: 

® inclusive use of all indoor and outdoor water areas at the 
same times, with unlimited bathing duration, for a 
standard admission charge;

necessitated by special circumstances (e.g. in spa resorts 
or for sporting competitions etc.).

INDOOR/OPEN AIR SWIMMING POOLS 


A combined indoor and open air swimming pool complex 
can, in certain circumstance, be created by adding an 
indoor pool or open air pool to an existing facility. However, 
in new projects, the indoor pool section should be the first 
to be built. 

The design should aim to connect the pool area of the 
open air pool with that of the indoor pool. This leads to 
better use during out-of-season times and allows central 
supervision and more economic technical servicing. The 
close proximity of the indoor and open air pool areas also 
makes flexible use easier. 

Connection between the two pools, preferably linking 
the shallow ends, can be made through a swimming 
channel. This should have a covered entrance with a hot air 
curtain or closing doors. Such a link allows bathers to reach 
the outdoor pool from indoors without coming into contact 
with cold outside air. 

Where the leisure area has catering facilities and a 
restaurant the diners should be given a good view of both 
pool sections. 

Access to the open air pool should be through the same 
entrance hall as the indoor pool. However, during peak 
times access should also be possible through a second 
covered entrance zone, ideally served by the same ticket 
offices and control areas as the main entry hall.

SAUNA 


a The sauna is more than a method of bathing: for many it is a type 
of physical cleansing, almost a ritual, and it is now an essential 
> part of all modern sports facilities. In Finland there is one sauna 
for every six people. They are built to a standard traditional 
design and used once a week, both communally within the family 
and also in public without segregation of the sexes. 
The classic location for saunas is next to a clear lake with 
woods and meadows for air bathing between sweat baths.

1 lobby which are created every 5-7 minutes by pouring a quarter litre 
: Chee eoee of water on to heated stones. The cycle between dry and damp 
4 reclining bench results in a strong stimulation of the skin and strengthens 
i Cen resistance to illness. The effect is intensified by periodic cold 


water treatment, massage and rest. 


Construction 

Wood block or timber construction is by far the most common 
and good thermal insulation of the exterior is essential because 
the temperature difference between inside and outside can 
often be over 100°C in winter. 

The bathing room should be as small as possible (<16m2, 
<2.5m high) and lined with dark coloured timber on the ceiling 
and walls to reduce heat radiation. Walls are solid softwood 
timber, with the exception of the oven area. The steps and 
benches are made of wood battens to give good air circulation 
and are at various heights, the top bench being about 1m 
beneath the ceiling. The benches are usually around 2m in 
length. All of the wood battens are nailed from below so that 
the body does not come into contact with hot nail heads. 

Benches should be easy to dismantle to allow easy cleaning. 
ee a iar The floor must be made of non-slip material, not wood strips.

AMUSEMENT ARCADES 


The types of machines found in amusement arcades will 
vary from country to country given that the setting up of 
games for gambling is subject to regulations and licensing. 
It is therefore necessary to take into account the licensing 
policies if it is intended to provide games which produce 
winnings of money or goods in a games arcade or similar 
premises. 

Where machines that provide winnings of goods or 
money are allowed in gaming halls, they must be 
Separated from the machines which are designed for 
amusement only. It is permissible, however, for adjacent 
gaming and amusement arcades to share the same toilet 
facilities > Q). 

The ‘Pachinko’ gaming halls, common. in Japan 
> 0 +) are not permitted in some European countries. 
Balls won from the machines can be exchanged for goods 
at the service counter. 

In the UK, gaming by means of machines is restricted 
and is governed by the Gaming Act 1968.

GROUP PRACTICES AND 
HEALTHCARE CENTRES 


Primary healthcare is delivered in the community at the first 
contact point between members of the public and health 
workers. In the past, people would see their general practitioners 
either at their homes or in the doctor's surgery. If necessary, they 
would be referred to specialists to receive care. However, the 
sustained trend towards specialisation amongst doctors starting 
out on their careers has produced a shift towards medical and 
diagnostic centres offering extensive medical services. The 
advantages for the patient are shorter waiting times and a 
greater possibility of being able to receive a diagnosis and 
treatment without having to be referred to another doctor. For 
the doctor, the advantages are the introduction of more 
regulated working hours and the ability to exchange and learn 
from the experiences of other doctors in the practice. The 
simplest form of care centre is the group practice. This is a 
combination of two or more practising doctors with shared staff 
and premises. 

Although the main core of the primary care service is the 
general medical practice, with the emphasis on the general 
practitioner (GP), modern healthcare centres increasingly 
comprise nursing and other professional staff of primary and 
community healthcare teams whose roles are also important. 
There could be, for example, nursing and midwifery teams 
(practice nurse, health visitor, district nurse, midwife, 
community psychiatric nurse, school nurse, etc.) as well as 
visiting therapists and practitioners in specialist disciplines. The 
members of the team work interdependently, although each has 
his/her role clearly defined. There are also the administration 
staff who run the centre (e.g. practice manager, receptionist, 
records clerk and secretary). Social workers and dental 
practitioners might also use the facilities.

GROUP PRACTICES 
AND HEALTHCARE 
CENTRES 


A primary healthcare centre therefore 
provides a range of medical services 
including: consultations, treatment 
diagnosis, minor surgery and health 
education. Sometimes it may also 
include day care for physiotherapy 
and occupational therapy, and out- 
patients’ emergency treatment. In 
some cases there may be in-patient 
short-stay beds. These centres can 
offer great flexibility and tend to serve 
an average population of between 
10000 and 30000 people. 

Any of these building types may 
include general medical practitioners, 
dental, ophthalmic and pharmaceutical 
practitioners, community nursing 
services, such as chiropody, physio- 
therapy and speech therapy, non-acute 
beds, resource, educational facilities, 
out-of-hours facilities for GPs, ‘drop-in 
treatment’ and minor surgery facilities. 

There are several factors that 
should be considered in the design of 
a primary healthcare building. These 
include: 
® Location of the building: should be 

convenient in relation to the people 

it serves. 

® Circulation: entrance and circ- 
ulation within the building must 
consider wheelchair users, 
parents with small children and 
people with disabilities, etc. 

© Effective zoning is required: public 
zone, Clinical zone, and staff zone. 

© Privacy and confidentiality are 
important, especially at the 
reception desk and clinical rooms 


during consultations and 
treatments. 

© Security and supervision in the 
premises will be necessary, 


including staff protection against 
personal assault and equipment 
safeguarded against theft and 
vandalism. 
® For running costs, efficient staffing, 
energy-efficiency, long-life and 
low-maintenance approaches 
should be adopted. 
© Flexibility and growth should be 
catered for: flexibility in the use of 
some spaces, and potential for 
future extension of the building. 
The following spaces should be 
considered. The design, number and 
areas (m2) of each of these spaces, 
should take account of several factors, 
including staff, the type and number 
of people to be served by the building, 
equipment and furniture, and with 
regard to functional content of the 
building, local circumstances, design 
guides: car parking spaces; main 
entrance; reception area; record 
storage; administration and office 
bases; waiting areas; consulting/ 
examination rooms; treatment rooms; 
minor surgery spaces; dental suites; 
multipurpose rooms; interview rooms; 
WCs for patients; WCs for staff; staff 
amenities; out-patient consulting and 
diagnostic facilities; beds; educational 
facilities; storage for each of the 
services; building services require- 
ments; grouping of spaces. 

The vocational regulations in 
individual countries must be 
observed because in some 
circumstances they may preclude 
some communal practices.

(1) Planning areas and planning levels for hospital construction 


General comments 

Medical institutions provide treatment for and care of patients with 
a wide range of acute and chronic conditions. The objectives of the 
medical care may vary in nature and extent and so need to be 
identified accurately. Hospitals therefore differ in the number of 
specialisms they support and the size of the specialist departments 
and treatment facilities; in their provision of specialist curative 
medicine, preventive medicine (prophylactics) and aftercare 
(rehabilitation), examination (diagnostics) and treatment (therapy); 
in the intensity of care, the standard of accommodation and level of 
welfare, psychiatric care, training and research activity. 

While early hospitals were consciously planned as medico- 
surgical institutions, nowadays a shift can be seen towards 
increasing humanisation of the facilities. Modern hospitals tend to 
be rather like hotels in nature; a residential atmosphere is 
considered to be more important than the uncompromising sanitary 
design of their predecessors. The length of stay of patients is getting 
progressively shorter, and there is a growing preference for rooms 
with one or two beds (particularly for private patients). 


Demarcation 

The general hospital is divided into operational areas of care 
provision, examination and treatment, supply and disposal, 
administration and technology. In addition, there are residential 
areas and possibly areas for teaching and research as well as 
support areas for service operations. All of these areas are precisely 
defined within the hospital. Opinions vary concerning the 
arrangement of the different areas but it is important to maintain the 
shortest practicable horizontal and vertical links while at the same 
time demarcating the individual departments as far as possible. 


Types 
Hospitals may be subdivided into the following categories: smallest 
(up to 50 beds), small (up to 150 beds), standard (up to 600 beds) 
and large hospitals. Very few of the smallest and large category 
hospitals have been built in recent times, the trend now seeming to 
be to create an even coverage of standard hospitals. In fact, modern 
health reforms have produced a noticeable reduction in the 
numbers of the smallest hospitals. The sponsors may be public, 
charitable or private or a mixture of these. 

Hospitals are divided by function into general, specialist and 
university hospitals.

deadlines op. success 


University hospitals 
University hospitals with maximum provision are to be considered 
equal to the medical academies and some large general hospitals. 
They have at their disposal particularly extensive diagnostic and 
therapeutic facilities and systematically carry out research and 
teaching. Lecture theatres and demonstration rooms should be 
included in such a way that operations are not interrupted by the 
observers. Larger wards should be planned so as to accommodate 
both visitors and observers. 

The amenities and special requirements of university hospitals 
frequently require a specially designed set of rooms. 


Specialist hospitals 

The number of specialist hospitals is growing fast because of the 
increasing focus on individual types of treatment or medical fields: 
casualty, rehabilitation, allergies, orthopaedics, gynaecology, etc. 
Also included in this category are special clinics dealing with, for 
example, cancers, skin problems, lung conditions, psychiatric 
disorders, and the like. In turn, these feed residential rehabilitation 
centres, nursing homes, special schools and old people’s homes. 


Bed requirements 
The following are typical patient numbers per 1000 inhabitants per 
year in a typical developed country (here, Germany in 1996) 


acute hospitals 180.1 


hospitals in total 183.7 special hospitals 3.6 


At present there are typically the following numbers of beds per 
1000 inhabitants: 
acute hospitals 6.9 


hospitals in total 7.5 special hospitals 0.6 


The average patient stay (in days) in 1996 was as follows: 


acute hospitals 11.4 


hospitals in total 12.1 special hospitals 47.4 


The number of beds available differs from one country to another. 
For example, in 1994/95, the total number of beds available in NHS 
hospitals in the UK was 4.8 per 1000 people; for acute beds the 
figure was 2.3 per 1000.

Planning organisation in flux 
Project management plays a central role in the timed 
planning and execution processes for a general hospital 


o Planning organisation today 


Building a hospital is a highly complex project and requires 
systematic planning to deliver the heterogeneity and 
flexibility required when such a large number of people are 
involved. The construction process must satisfy the needs 
of a number of functions: accommodation, research (in 
university hospitals), teaching, medical activity, storage 
and administration. A proper planning methodology 
enables this to be done by utilising a variety of room 
dimensions and installations. 

The planning team, consisting of architects, doctors, 
nurses, specialist engineers and administrative staff, needs 
to co-operate closely throughout both the planning and 
construction stages because the design brief could, at any 
time before completion, be compromised by unforeseen 
developments which highlight inadequacies or errors. 

It takes 8-10 years for a hospital construction project to 
move from initial planning discussions to commissioning. 
This is equivalent to the time required for the development 
of a whole new generation of medical technology, which 
puts the building at risk of being out of date when ready for 
use if conventional construction planning and construction 
methods are used. 

To ensure the planning of the building is realistic, it is 
important to co-operate with related business and 
industrial concerns from an early stage. For example, 
because the size of equipment is constantly changing in 
parallel with advances in computer technology, it can have 
major consequences for the room arrangements. The size 
of individual departments (e.g. radiology, radiotherapy) has 
also changed considerably in recent years so consultation 
with the intended users is therefore important. 

Health service reforms will have a substantial influence 
on hospital planning in the future as will the trend for 
individual medical specialisations to move out of general 
hospitals and set up separate clinical centres with their own 
administration (e.g. radiology, geriatric day clinics, 
ambulant treatment centres). In addition, ever greater 
influence is being exerted on planning by fire prevention 
and sound reduction requirements, as well as building 
regulations and the requirements of the related 
professional bodies. 


Period of use 
Building fabric, interior works and fitting out are subject to 
different periods of use. 

As much as possible of the construction should be of 
frame type in order to allow flexibility in the fitting out. 


HOSPITALS 


Construction Planning 


Installations and interiors are, depending on the 
department and writing-off periods, changed about every 
5-10 years, which can impose serious contraints on the 
Spatial arrangements, particularly for large specialist 
equipment (e.g. linear accelerators). The installation and 
removal of such equipment must be taken into account 
during the planning stage such that the structure of the 
building does not have to be altered (which would, of 
course, have serious cost implications). 


Economy 

Possible changes in use, as well as the differing impact of 
wear, have an effect on construction planning and planning 
methodology. These criteria should be taken into account in 
economic assessments, together with short operational 
paths, appropriate work processes and general functional 
arrangements. 


Construction costs 

The building costs should conform to the relevant 
regulations and guidelines. Typical cost allocations are as 
follows: 


¢ weather sealed structure 

¢ fitting out and services 

- installations and medical equipment 
¢ incidental costs 


approx. 22% 
approx. 40% 
approx. 20% 
approx. 18% 


In the planning of new buildings, about 70-100 m2 must be 
allowed per sick bed, and roughly 200-280 m3 per bed must 
be allowed for alterations (which includes all ancillary spaces 
such as environmental controls and storage spaces). 


Design rules 

Hospitals are often build in several phases or are added in 
Stages to existing hospitals. Therefore, the design 
(circulation system, floor levels) and construction must be 
such as to allow a variety of extension possibilities. 


Affinities 

From the commencement of the first design activities, 
Clarity must be achieved within the design team about the 
affinity between the individual operational spheres. The 
need for close co-operation between various hospital 
departments is facilitated by spatial proximity.

Planning Conception 


Location: The site should offer sufficient space for self- 
contained residential areas and hospital departments. It 
should be a quiet location with no possibility of future 
intrusive development not excluded by regulations on 
adjacent sites. No loss of amenity should result from fog, 
wind, dust, smoke, odours or insects. The land must not be 
contaminated and adequate open areas for later expansion 
must also be planned. 


Orientation: The most suitable orientation for treatment and 
operating rooms is between north-west and north-east. For 
nursing ward facades, south to south-east is favourable: 
pleasant morning sun, minimal heat build-up, little 
requirement for sun shading, mild in the evenings. East and 
west facing rooms have comparatively deeper sun 
penetration, though less winter sun. The orientation of wards 
in hospitals with a short average stay is not so important. 
Some specialist disciplines might require rooms on the north 
side so that patients are not subjected to direct sunlight. 


Concept: An existing hospital is to be expanded; the design 
includes four building phases. A large enclosed area 
containing a park will be created to allow windows to be 
opened without the need to tackle problems of noise 
protection.

Outpatients 

The location of outpatient 
treatment rooms is_ of 
particular importance. 
Separation of the routes 
taken by outpatient 
emergencies and inpatients 
should be given 
consideration early in the 
planning process. 

The number of patients 
concerned will depend on 
the overall size and 
technical facilities of the 
hospital. Where there is a 
consistently high number of 
Outpatients a separate area 
can be created away from 
the other hospital 
operations. However, there 
must still be close links to 
the X-ray and_= surgical 
departments.

HOSPITALS 
Dimensional Co-ordination 


Modules: Modular dimensional co-ordination is the best starting 
point for meeting strategic design requirements. Reference systems, 
basic modules and multiple modules for construction details, layout 
and dimensions of building parts are all to be considered. For 
hospital construction the preferred module dimensions 12M = 1.20m 
are recommended, or 6M or 3M if the increments are too numerous. 
In this system all the building components are co-ordinated with 
each other. The supporting structure can be drawn in by producing a 
horizontal and vertical basic grid. 

An agreement on dimensions has considerable consequences 
for building construction, and the building systems available on the 
market must conform to this dimensional co-ordination. It is 
therefore helpful to prescribe a normal standard dimension in 
planning. The benefits of dimensional co-ordination are shorter 
construction periods and easier replacement of interior fittings, with 
less disruption of service. The schematic ground floor plan of the 
Cantonal Hospital for the City of Basle shows the structural grid, 
support dimensions, fagade position and layout and dimensions of 
core zones and shafts. 


Use of grids: The Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London is 
one of the largest hospitals in Europe and demonstrates how a 
hospital of this size can be organised and planned around a simple 
grid. The large internal courtyards allow natural lighting into most of 
the rooms on all floors. The design grid, on which all subsequent 
divisions are based, measures about 7.2 x 2.2m. Both the 
examination rooms and wards (with centres at 3.6m) are designed 
to comply. The necessary escape stairs are situated in the internal 
courtyards or on the outside of the building.

HOSPITALS 
Dimensional Co-ordination 


Structural grid 

The constructional grid must provide a precise guide as 
well as allowing for differentiation of areas for the main 
functions, support functions and vehicular traffic. 

A comparison of the individual operational areas and the 
rooms they require should result in a structural grid which 
is suitable for all functions. 

The various operations centres can be planned most 
appropriately with a column grid spacing of 7.20m or 7.80m. 
Smaller construction grids are problematic because large 
rooms (e.g. operating theatres) which must be free from 
internal columns are more difficult to accommodate. 


Room schedule 

A room schedule showing the overall classifications and 
requirements of the hospital must be drawn up in order to 
generate an appropriate structural grid and ground plan. 
Depending on the type of hospital, this will not detail all of 
the possibilities but will cover only the key functional 
rooms. The specifics of the room schedule must be 
discussed with the users so it is therefore sensible to set up 
a detailed room-by-room specification procedure. Specialist 
areas within a hospital can affect the nature and size of 
other individual operations centres and close co-operation 
between planners and users will prevent possible problems 
arising later. 

An overview of the size of the individual operations 
centres can be obtained using reference area values. 
However, these are only recommendations and depend on 
the orientation and services of the actual project in 
question.

HOSPITALS 
Corridors, Doors, Stairs, Lifts 


Corridors > (1)- ©) 

Corridors must be designed for the maximum expected 
circulation flow. Generally, access corridors must be at least 
1.50m wide. Corridors in which patients will be transported 
on trolleys should have a minimum effective width of 
2.25m. The suspended ceiling in corridors may be installed 
up to 2.40m. Windows for lighting and ventilation should 
not be further than 25m apart. The effective width of the 
corridors must not be constricted by projections, columns 
or other building elements. Smoke doors must be installed 
in ward corridors in accordance with local regulations. 


Doors 

When designing doors the hygiene requirements should be 
considered. The surface coating must withstand the long- 
term action of cleaning agents and disinfectants, and they 
must be designed to prevent the transmission of sound, 
odours and draughts. Doors must meet the same standard 
of noise insulation as the walls surrounding them. A 
double-skinned door leaf construction must meet a 
recommended minimum sound reduction requirement of 
25dB. The clear height of doors depends on their type and 
function: 


normal doors 2.10-—2.20m 

vehicle entrances, oversized doors 2.50m 

transport entrances 2.70-2.80m 

minimum height on approach roads 3.50m 
Stairs 


For safety reasons stairs must be designed in such a way 
that if necessary they can accommodate all of the vertical 
circulation. The relevant national safety and building 
regulations will, of course, apply. Stairs must have handrails 
on both sides without projecting tips. Winding staircases 
cannot be included as part of the regulatory staircase 
provision. The effective width of the stairs and landings in 
essential staircases must be a minimum of 1.50 m and 
should not exceed 2.50 m. Doors must not constrict the 
useful width of the landings and, in accordance with hospital 
regulations, doors to the staircases must open in the 
direction of escape. 

Step heights of 170mm are permissible and the 
minimum required tread depth is 280mm. It is better to 
have a rise/tread ratio of 150:300 mm. 


Lifts — (8) Q) 


Lifts transport people, medicines, laundry, meals and 
hospital beds between floors, and for hygiene and aesthetic 
reasons separate lifts must be provided for some of these. 
In buildings in which care, examination or treatment areas 
are accommodated on upper floors, at least two lifts 
suitable for transporting beds must be provided. The 
elevator cars of these lifts must be of a size that allows 
adequate room for a bed and two accompanying people; 
the internal surfaces must be smooth, washable and easy to 
disinfect; the floor must be non-slip. Lift shafts must be fire- 
resistant. 

One multipurpose lift should be provided per 100 beds, 
with a minimum of two for smaller hospitals. In addition 
there should be a minimum of two smaller lifts for portable 
equipment, staff and visitors:

HOSPITALS 
Surgical Department 


Centralisation: advantages and disadvantages 

In the past, surgical operations centres tended to be 
planned within the hospital as a centrally located 
examination and treatment unit for use by various specialist 
departments. The reasons for this were better utilisation of 
space, equipment and staff, better patient provision 
through centralised service functions under the 
management of specialists, and hygiene considerations. 
The possible disadvantages of particularly large centralised 
surgical departments are high organisational costs and an 
increased risk of infection because of the large numbers of 
people brought together. A further disadvantage is the 
combination of septic and aseptic operations in one centre. 
A plan for septic and aseptic surgical units must be 
discussed with surgeons and hygienists. Current designs 
for large hospitals have separate units for septic and aseptic 
operations as a rule. External surgical units can generally 
better meet the requirements. When deciding the location 
of the surgical department, service relationships with other 
operations centres must be checked. These include 
reception, the emergency service, casualty surgery, 
obstetrics, endoscopy and specialist clinics. 


Function and layout 

In the surgical department, treatment is given to the 
patients whose conditions have been diagnosed but cannot 
be cured solely with medication. It should be close to the 
intensive care department, the recovery room and the 
central sterilisation area because there is extensive 
interaction between these departments and so easy access 
must be assured. The hygiene precautions require the 
surgical unit to be isolated from the rest of the hospital 
operations. This is achieved by a demarcation system using 
lobbies. 

Surgical departments are best located centrally in the 
core area of the hospital where they are easy to reach. The 
reception area for emergency cases (casualties) must be as 
close as possible to the surgical area since such patients 
often need to be moved into surgery immediately. 


Organisation of the surgery department 
Every surgical department requires the following rooms: 


operating theatre 40-48 m2 
entry room 15-20 m2 
exit room 15-20 m2 
washroom 12-15 m2 
equipment room 10-15 m2 


In new projects, it is permissible for two operating theatres 
to share the same exit room. Essential to surgical 
departments are a staff lobby, patient lobby, clean work 
corridor, anaesthetic workroom, waste lobby, supply lobby, 
standing area for two operating trolleys and, nearby, the 
recovery room. 

The patient demarcation lobbies are also used for bed- 
to-bed transfer, preparation of operating tables and ward 
beds, and theatre stores. An appropriate size is around 
35 m2 and fittings should inlude wash-basins and an electric 
conveyor for bed-to-bed transfer. 

— (1) Ideal floor plan of an external surgical area with a 
direct link to the main building. The corridor system its 
separated into staff corridors with links to the functional 
rooms and pre-operative and post-operative patient 
corridors. A requirement when planning a new building Is 
that it must be expandable on at least one side. 

> 2) Floor plan of the central operating area at the 
Northern Hospital Centre, Dortmund, with five operating 
theatres and additional rooms. Pre-operative and post- 
operative patients are separated and the staff circulate via 
the area accommodating non-anaesthetised patients area.

Routeing 

Different activities should be separated in order to reduce the 
transmission of germs through contact. The single corridor 
system, in which the pre-operative and post-operative patients, 
pre-operative and post-operative staff, clean and non-clean 
goods use a single working corridor without segregation, is no 
longer standard. It is better to have dual corridor systems in 
which patients and staff or patients and non-clean materials are 
separated. The best combination of the individual requirements 
has not been clarified and they are therefore dealt with 
individually. One effective strategy is to separate the flow of 
patients from the working areas used by the surgical staff.

HOSPITALS 


Main Surgical Rooms 


A number of necessary supply and workrooms adjoin the 
operating theatre directly. The operating theatre should be 
designed to be as square as possible to allow working whatever 
direction the operating table is turned in. A suitable size would 
be 6.50 x 6.50m, with a clear height of 3.00m and an extra 
height allowance of roughly 0.70m for air conditioning and 
other services. Operating theatres should be fitted out as 
uniformly as possible, in order to offer maximum flexibility, and 
centre on a transportable operating table system which is 
mounted on a fixed base in the middle of the room. Natural 
lighting in the operating theatre is psychologically 
advantageous but often cannot be provided because of the 
layout. Where it is, there must be the means to shut out the light 
completely (e.g. eye operations are carried out in very dark 
rooms). Nowadays service connections and technical supply 
facilities are generally supplied via Suspended anaesthesia 
equipment. Otherwise, connections for vacuum lines, nitrous 
oxide and emergency power must be placed at least 1.20m 
above floor level. 

It is important to isolate the highly sterile areas to which 
sterile instruments are supplied. Division of the Operating 
theatres into septic and aseptic zones is a matter of medical 
controversy, but is a sensible precaution. Floors and walls must 
be smooth throughout and easily washed: decorative or 
structural projections should be avoided. 


Anaesthetics room 

The anaesthetics room should be approximately 3.80 x 3.80m 
in size and have electric sliding doors into the operating theatre 
(clear width 1.40m). These doors must have windows to givea 
visual link with the operating theatre. The room should be 
equipped with a refrigerator, draining sink (sluice), rinsing line, 
cupboards for cannulas, connections for anaesthesia 
equipment and emergency power. 


Anaesthetic discharge room 

This is set out identically to the anaesthetics room. The door to 
the working corridor should be designed as a swing door with 
a clear width of 1.25m. 


Washroom 

Division into clean and non-clean washrooms is ideal, but from 
a hygiene point of view a single large room is adequate. The 
minimum width of the room should be 1.80m. For each 
operating theatre there should be three non-splash wash-basins 
with foot controls. Doors into the operating theatre must have 
an inspection window and, if they are electrical, be opened by 
foot controls. Swing doors can be used if cost Saving is a 
priority. 


Sterile goods room 

The size of this room is more flexible but there must be 
sufficient shelf and cupboard space and it must be accessed 
directly from the operating theatre. One room of roughly 10m2 
is required per operating theatre. 


Equipment room 

Although direct access to the operating theatre is preferable, it 
is not always feasible; where direct access cannot be provided, 
the equipment room must be located as close as possible to the 
theatre in order to reduce waiting times. A room size of 
approximately 20m2 should be allowed. 


Substerilisation room 

This room may or may not be connected directly to the 
operating theatre’s sterile area. It contains an non-clean area for 
non-sterile material and a clean area for prepared sterile items. 
It should be equipped with a sink, storage surface, work surface 
and steam sterilisers. Linking a substerilisation room to several 
Operating theatres causes hygiene problems and so should be 
avoided. Note that surgical instruments are prepared in the 
central sterilising unit, which lies outside the surgical area. 


Plaster room 

For hygiene reasons this is not located in the surgical zone but 
in the outpatient area. In emergencies the patient must be 
channelled through lobbies in order to get to the operating 
theatre.

~» @) Beds must not be too close together in the recovery room and 
allow enough space for the anaesthetist and his equipment to reach 
at least three sides. Awkward additional equipment, such as 
sublimation stands, also requires adequate space for ease of 
movement. The patient is supplied via mobile service bridges with 
connections for a vacuum line, nitrous oxide, oxygen, power and 
lighting. All the necessary equipment can be accommodated in a 
suspended equipment trolley. 

The route between the recovery room, the operating theatre and 
the ward should contain several doors and be as short as possible 
so the anaesthetist can get to the patients quickly in case of 
emergency.

Recovery room requirements 

The recovery room must accommodate the post-operative patients 
from more than one operating theatre. The number of beds required 
is calculated as 1.5 times the number of operating theatres. 
Adjoining is a small sluice room with drainage sinks. A nurse’s 
monitoring position must be provided from which all the beds can 
be seen. Designs should allow in daylight to help the patients to 
orientate themselves. 





HOSPITALS 


Post-operative Facilities 


Clean room technology and air conditioning 

The air conditioning system is a vital part of clean room technology. 
A typical example uses a low-turbulence displacement with an even 
speed of moving air (0.45m/sec) to produce a laminar flow, ahead of 
which any germs and particles released are propelled out of the 
room. An additional directed jet with the flow directed towards the 
Operating area allows air turbulence to be minimised. The 
combination of contaminated air and fresh air (clean room air) can 
also then largely be avoided. To maintain the hygiene of the 
Operating equipment an area of approximately 3.00 x 3.00m should 
be allowed. 

The air conditioning system also reduces the level of airborne 
germs by filtering, diluting and compressing the air before 
introducing the appropriately prepared air in the quantity required. 
For example, 15-20 air changes per hour are required to ensure 
adequate decontamination of the air between operations. 

To create a zone which is as germ/particle-free as possible within 
the operating theatre, there must be no uncontrolled inward air flow 
from neighbouring rooms. This can be achieved by hermetic sealing 
of the operating theatre (all joints sealed as far as possible during 
construction) and/or by protective pressurising (i.e. highest pressure 
in the operating theatre, followed by the anaesthesia rooms, and the 
lowest pressure in the auxiliary rooms, thus creating a pressure 
gradient which moves air outwards from the theatre to the areas 
requiring less protection). Operating theatre windows must therefore 
be equipped with sealable ventilation grills. Specific regulations 
determine the flow of air between the rooms in the surgical area. 


Auxiliary functions 

The rooms for auxiliary functions do not need to be in the immediate 
area of the operating theatre. Separation by a corridor which is not 
intended for patient use is advisable. 


Nurses’ lounge 

The dimensions of this room depend on the size of the surgical 
department. It should be assumed that there are eight members of 
staff per surgical team (doctors, theatre nurses, anaesthesia nurses). 
In the case of surgical units with more than two operating theatres, 
it is appropriate to separate smokers from non-smokers. The lounge 
must offer sufficient seating, cupboards and a sink. 


Nurses’ workstations 

These should be located centrally and have large glass screens to 
allow the working corridor to be viewed. In addition to a desk they 
must have cupboards and walls on which organisational schedule 
planners can be mounted. 


Dictation room 

No larger than 5m? in size, such rooms are where the doctors 
prepare reports following an operation. They are not absolutely 
necessary. 


Pharmacy 

A 20m? pharmacy can supply a combination of anaesthetics and 
surgical medication and other materials, particularly if a space-saving 
rotating shelving system is installed. 


Cleaning room 

A size of 5m2 is sufficient for cleaning rooms. They should be close 
to the operating theatre since cleaning and disinfection are carried 
out after each operation. 


Standing area for clean beds 

Close to the patient demarcation lobby there should be sufficient 
space to stand beds which have been cleaned and prepared. The 
requirement is for one additional clean bed for each operating table. 


WCs 
For hygiene reasons, toilets should be located only within the 
lobbies and not in the surgical area.

SURGERY SAFETY REQUIREMENTS 


The operating theatre should be connected to the 
anaesthetics room, discharge room, a wash room and 
sterile materials room via electric sliding doors, fitted on the 
outer side of the theatre so as not to constrict the space 
within. The opening mechanisms must be operated by foot 
switches for hygiene reasons. In the rooms for auxiliary 
functions, swing doors with a clear width of 1.00-1.25m are 
sufficient. 

It must be assumed that main anaesthetics rooms 
contain explosive mixtures of gases (vapours, oxygen or 
nitrous oxide). These may also pass into surgical areas, 
preparation rooms and plaster rooms. To counteract this 
accumulation of anaesthetic gases in the air, electrical and 
electro-medical connections are to be placed a minimum of 
1.20 m above floor level. Explosion protection measures 
also relate to the avoidance of electrostatic charges. 

Protective measures in the main anaesthetics rooms are: 

°* avoid materials which produce large electrostatic 

charges when rubbed or separated (e.g. plastic cloth) 
use conductive materials (e.g. conductive rubber) 
equalise charges through conducting floor 
maintain constant humidity between 60 and 65% 
A back-up power supply is required for surgical equipment 
so that, in the event of a power cut, the operation can be 
continued and completed. Among other things, the 
following must continue to be operable: 


° at least one operating lamp at each operating table, 
with a supply which will last for at least three hours 

* equipment for maintaining vital bodily functions (e.g. 
for respiration, anaesthesia and resuscitation) 


Specific regulations apply to operating rooms in which X- 
ray equipment is in operation. They define the lead 
thicknesses required in order to weaken the radiation 
sufficiently for maximum exposure not to be exceeded. 
Even the doors must have lead lining (e.g. 1mm) 

National standards provide conversion factors for usual 
building materials such as steel, concrete and masonry. 

Rooms for storage of anaesthetic agents must be fire- 
resistant and not connected to operating theatres, delivery 
rooms or anaesthetics rooms. 


Lighting 
Lighting in the operating area must be adjustable in order 
to provide light at different angles according to the position 
of the surgical incision. The most frequently used lighting 
system is the mobile ceiling-pendant operating light. It 
consists of a main ceiling light which rotates and pivots and 
is generally equipped with an additional light on a 
secondary arm. The main light is made up of a large 
number of smaller lights in order to avoid heavy shadows. 
Occasionally nowadays egg-shaped operating theatres are 
being planned with integrated ceiling spotlights. 
Guidelines for lighting in hospitals recommend the 
nominal lighting strength for operating theatres as 1000 lux 
and 500 lux for auxiliary surgical rooms. 


Central sterilisation — (5) 
This is where all hospital instruments are prepared. The 
majority of instruments are used by the surgical 
department (40%), surgical intensive and internal intensive 
care (15% each). For this reason central sterilisation should 
be installed close to these specialist areas. It is 
recommended that the sterilisation area be situated in areas 
with relatively low volumes of traffic (both people and 
materials). 

The number of sterilisers is dependent on the size of the 
hospital and surgical department, and can occupy an area 
of approximately 40-120 m2. 


HOSPITALS 


Demarcation 


A ‘demarcation area’ is formed by the intermediate zone 
(‘lobby’) between the care area and the 
examination/treatment area. 

Demarcation may be achieved in different ways 
depending on the required function and specialist area: 
ide patient lobby, staff lobby, combined staff and visitor lobby, 


ba supply and disposal lobby, gown lobby, lobbies before 


a 
ell 





room size 
4.8x6.0m 







intensive care rooms. In addition, the lobbies differ 
according to their hygiene function (contact control, air 
control) and the constructional requirement (single-lobby 
control, multi-lobby control, air conditioned and non-air 





Bed-to-bed mechanical Example of an enclosed eo 

: conditioned control). 
transfer device separates patient transfer unit ; ; ; ; 
operating department from The patient who is to undergo surgery is taken into the 


entrance area (by Maquet) ‘patient lobby’ where he/she is placed on the operating table 
with the aid of a mechanical bed-to-bed transfer device. 

Generally, regulations require separation into clean and 
non-clean areas. The boundary may be marked by a 
threshold which cannot be crossed. Direct access routes 
must be kept clear for emergencies. 

Medical and nursing personnel pass through the ‘staff 
lobby’ into separate male and female treatment rooms. The 
demarcated operations centre is reached first via an non- 
clean outer room in which people wash and change and 
then via the clean inner room where surgical clothing is 
provided. On leaving the centre the used surgical clothing is 
left in the non-clean room and the demarcation lobby is 
exited via the outer room. 

Shared ‘staff and visitor lobbies’ should be located in 
front of operations centres, from which infections requiring 
preferential treatment may emanate (isolation and intensive 
wards). Here single-chamber systems are sufficient, these 
taking up less space. 

Highly sterile materials, equipment and laundry are 
channelled into the operations centre via ‘supply and 
disposal lobbies’. These rooms frequently serve also as 
storage rooms. 

The demarcation areas do not necessarily have to be 
rooms. They may instead be formed by segregating traffic 
areas. However, there must still be sufficient space in the 
operations centre for storage of sterile goods or waste. 

The disposal demarcation lobby should not be 
overlooked because waste storage within the operations 
centre can be a source of hygiene risks. 

‘Gown demarcation lobbies’ are found at the transition 
between areas with differing hygiene requirements (e.g. 
between the non-clean and clean sides of bed preparation) 
and before rooms which are to be protected from infection 
or from which infection may emanate (e.g. isolation wards). 

Demarcation lobbies before intensive care rooms are 
required before approximately 30% of the operations 
centres and are to be agreed with the hospital hygienists. 
These lobby areas must contain a workstation for continual 
monitoring of the most seriously ill patients and also allow

HOSPITALS 
Intensive Care Area 


The task of intensive care is to prevent life-threatening 
disruption of the vital bodily functions: for instance, disruption 
of breathing, cardiovascular and metabolic disturbances, 
infections, severe pain and organ failures (e.g. liver, kidneys). 
The services of intensive care include monitoring and 
treatment as well as care of the patient. Special constructional 
and medical organisational measures are required for patients 
with paraplegia, burns and mental problems, which differ from 
usual intensive medicine. 

The organisation of intensive medicine is oriented towards 
specialist disciplines such as neurosurgery, heart/thorax 
surgery, transplant surgery and neurology, or to 
interdisciplinary areas of surgery and internal medicine. In 
normal hospitals without a particular medical specialism, it is 
customary to divide intensive medicine into surgery and 
internal medicine. 


Arrangement: The intensive care department must be a 
separate area, and only accessible through lobbies (for 
hygiene reasons). Note that according to hospital regulations, 
each intensive care unit must be a separate fire compartment. 
Apart from the patient and staff lobbies, visitors should only 
access the unit through a visitors’ lobby (waiting room). The 
central point of an intensive care unit must be an open nurses’ 
workstation from which it is possible to oversee every room. 
The recovery room of the operating department is often 
located in the intensive care unit so the patients can 
economically be cared for by the same staff. 

The number of patients per unit should be between six and 
ten in order to avoid overloading the medical and nursing 
personnel and to provide the patient with the best possible 
care. One nurse’s duty station, a_ sterile workstation 
(medication and infusion preparation), one materials room and 
one equipment room per unit (six to ten beds) should be 
included in the plan. 


Arrangement of the bed spaces: The beds may be placed in an 
open, closed or combined arrangement. With an open 
arrangement a large floor area is required. All the beds must 
be in clear view of a central nurses’ duty station and the 
patients are separated by moveable half-height partitions 
which should be lightweight and easy to move. With a closed 
arrangement the patients are accommodated in separate 
rooms which, again, must be in sight of a central nurses’ 
workstation. Hygienically and psychologically the closed 
arrangement is preferable because the patients are extremely 
vulnerable. A compromise which is frequently adopted is to 
provide two or three beds in separate rooms. 

The ideal plan is star shaped, with rooms radiating out from 
the nurses’ workstation, but this is often not feasible because of 
space restrictions so more traditional arrangements are used. 


Auxiliary functions: For auxiliary functions the following areas 
and rooms should be planned in: operating theatre for minor 
interventions (25-30m2), laboratory space, kitchenette, 
substerilisation (20m, clean material room, non-clean 
workroom, cleaning room, lounge for relatives, duty doctor's 
room, documentation room, possibly a consulting room, and 
sanitary facilities (co-ordinated with the hygiene department). 

The operations centre must be self-sufficient in terms of 
medical facilities. Connection lines for oxygen, compressed air 
and vacuum suction must be available at all beds and, in 
addition to normal electrical sockets, low-voltage (for the 
nurse-call system) and high-voltage (e.g. for portable X-ray 
equipment) power must be provided. 

The intensive surgical medicine ward should be close to 
and preferably on the same level as the surgical department 
and internal intensive medicine ward. It should also be close to 
reception and the emergency service operations centre. 
Intensive wards which are not associated with a specialist area 
should be close to the outpatients and surgical department. 
Short routes to the clinical laboratory and to the blood bank are 
preferable. 


Areas for patient care should be enclosed and through-traffic 
kept to a minimum by careful planning of the circulation 
routes. Wards must have windows to give natural lighting 
whereas the service rooms (treatment areas, nurses’ rooms, 
pharmacy etc.) can be located in the artificially lit inner area. 


Care departments 

The care departments are each assigned to a specialist 
discipline and subdivided into care groups. To maintain an 
adequate level of supervision each care area should contain 
no more than 16-24 beds. For economical use of staff, two 
workstations are often placed together and connected to a 
large central nurses’ service area (caring for about 30-34

Care Areas 


patients). The arrangement of the rooms is dependent upon 
the class, type and seriousness of the illness. The following 
nursing areas should be distinguished: normal nursing area, 
intensive care area, special care area. 

There are fewer beds per care group in the intensive care 
and special care areas (6-12 beds, depending on the size of 
the hospital). The rooms must be arranged such that there is 
sufficient freedom of movement and that beds are accessible 
from both sides as well as the end. An adequate number of 
cupboards for patients’ belongings must be provided as 
should space for care aids (trolleys, commodes) and 
equipment.

HOSPITALS 
Care Areas 


‘Normal care units’ are used for general inpatient care (the 
main function of general hospitals), particularly for short- 
term and acute illnesses, primarily with a short length of 
stay. These units can be stacked depending on the space 
requirement and organisational structure. Seriously ill 
patients are moved from normal care groups to intensive 
care groups. 

‘Intensive care groups’ are for patients under constant 
observation and tend to be assigned to particular 
examination and treatment rooms. Generally, these rooms 
should be larger than normal care rooms because more 
instruments and equipment need to be accommodated. 

Patients with special needs are placed in ‘special care 
units’. These include newborn babies, people with 
infectious diseases, the chronically ill, rehabilitation 
patients, neurotics and hypochondriacs. The length of stay 
of these patients is frequently longer than average. 


Function and structure 

The individual care areas in a hospital are attached to the 
specific medical faculties (e.g. surgery, medical, accident 
and emergency etc,) and therefore need to be planned as 
separate units. Essentially, they cater for pre- and post- 
Operative patients who must stay in the hospital for 
Observation and recovery. The patients’ basic bodily 
functions are routinely tested on the wards but more 
extensive examination is carried out in separate treatment 
rooms. Each station must have at least one assistant 
doctor's room and two doctor's rooms in which minor 
examination and treatment can be carried out. 

The hierarchical hospital structure, in both medical and 
nursing domains, must be reflected in the planning (e.g. 
separate rooms for station supervisors, assistant doctors, 
senior doctors). 


Layout of rooms 

Medical rooms and washrooms should be accessed from 
the main station corridor which must be easily supervised 
from the glazed nurses’ workstation to prevent 
unauthorised entry. The logistics of delivering patient care 
is an important factor in the cost-effectiveness of the 
department so it is desirable to plan the necessary supply 
and disposal rooms for medicines, linen, refuse, food etc. 
centrally in groups around the nurses’ workstation. 


Nursing teams 
Each station (18-24 patients) is served by an independent 
nursing team which has full responsibility for patient care. 
As the nurses’ workstation has to be constantly occupied, it 
is sensible to plan a direct connection to the nurses’ 
kitchenette and rest room. 

One-to-one nursing care is very much the exception 
nowadays and the rising costs of such provision mean that 
it is unlikely to be feasible in the future. 


Wet cells 

The strategy of combining one-, two- and three-bed rooms 
is specified by the financial department. The same 
constraints are also applied to the equipping of wet cells 
with WCs and showers or baths. If applicable, separate 
shower rooms are permitted.

HOSPITALS 


Care Areas 


Size of the patient rooms 

The patients’ beds must be accessible from three sides and 
this sets the limits for the overall room sizes. The smallest 
size for a one-bed room is 10 m2; for a two- and three-bed 
room, a minimum of 8m2 per bed should be allowed (in 
accordance with hospital building regulations). 

The room must be wide enough for a second bed to be 
wheeled out of the room without disturbing the first bed 
(minimum width 3.20 m). 

Next to each bed must be a night table and, where 
appropriate, towards the window there should be a table 
(900 x 900 mm) with chairs (one chair per patient). The fitted 
cupboards (usually against the corridor wall) must be 
capable of being opened without moving the beds or night 
tables. 

In new buildings, the wet cells should be located towards 
the inside, off the station corridor, because future 
renovations will most likely make use of the external walls 
as the means of extending the existing areas. 


Equipping the patient room 

Around the walls there should be a strip made of plastic or 
wood (at least 400-700 mm above floor level) to protect the 
wall from damage caused by the movement of beds, night 
tables and trolleys. Similar strips should be included in the 
station corridors. 

The patients’ cupboards must be large enough to store 
all of the belongings they have with them. It is best to have 
a suitcase locker over the cupboard and a lockable 
valuables section within the cupboard itself. A coin- 
operated locking system is recommended because keys 
often get lost. A lockable staff cupboard for medicines 
should also be planned for. Hinges which allow doors to 
open through 135 degrees should be fitted to all cupboards. 

The room doors must be 1260 x 2130 mm in size and a 
design which gives a noise reduction of at least 32dB 
should be considered (note that noise reduction seals are 
often necessary). The closing mechanisms must be 
overhead and the door furniture should be designed to suit 
the needs of patients and staff carrying trays. 

The service supply duct runs behind the beds and 
supplies oxygen, a vacuum line and compressed air via 
special sockets. Power points, reading lights, telephone, 
nurse call and radio sockets are also housed in this duct. 

Whether each patient room is equipped with a shower 
often depends on the financing of the project. However, a 
wash-basin and WC are today standard in new buildings. 
Attention must be paid to the heights of the wash-basin and 
the WC: the wash-basin needs to be roughly 860 mm from 
the floor to allow wheelchairs underneath and the WC for 
wheelchair users should have a seat height of about 
490mm. Each station must also have additional WCs for 
staff, visitors and wheelchair users.

Care Areas 


Non-clean workroom 

Each care area station must have a workroom, 
approximately 10m2 in size, for handling soiled materials. 
The room will contain a sink and sluice, preferably in 
stainless steel, and fully tiled walls are recommended. 


Nurses’ work area > (1) 

The nurses’ workstation should be situated in a central 
position and requires a size of about 25-30 m2. The corridor 
wall must be glazed, but fireproofing is also a consideration 
so it is advisable to consult the fire officer and fireproofing 
specialists. 


Rest rooms/kitchenette 
Roughly 15m2 should be allocated for staff breaktime 


facilities. In larger hospitals consider the inclusion of a 
smoking area. 


Station doctor 

The station doctor must be provided with a 16-20m?2 room 
in which to examine patients. In addition to a desk, there 
should be ample shelving and an examination couch on 
which the doctor can rest when on-call. > @) 


Clean workroom 

The clean workroom should have an area of about 10m? 
and be equipped with fixed shelving (600mm deep) or a 
flexible storage system consisting of modules which can be 
filled up in the central stores. 


Patients’ bathroom 

Bathrooms are often equipped with a tub which is 
accessible from three sides to ease the lifting of patients. 
Showers are an option for more mobile patients and can 
also be suitable for wheelchair users provided enough 
space is allowed (1400 x 1400 mm). > @) 


Plant room 
Each station must have a small (approximately 8m2) plant 
room equipped with a fuseboard. 


Patients’ lounge 
A size of approximately 22-25m? should be allocated to 


serve aS a general meeting place for patients. The design 
should emulate a domestic environment.

HOSPITALS 


Treatment Areas 


Internal medicine treatment area 

This area brings together all the examination techniques 
and treatments associated with internal medicine which, 
depending on the size of the hospital, can encompass: 
cardiology, angiology, pulmonology, endocrinology and 
metabolism, and gastroenterology. The basic facilities 
comprise examination rooms (25m2), a_secretarial/ 
administration office (20m?) between the senior 
physician’s room (15-20m2) and the chief physician's 
room (20-25m2), an archive room and patient waiting 
areas. Staff stand-by rooms (15m2) should also be 
provided. 


Radiology 

Radiology includes the specialist areas which use ionising 
radiation for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. This 
includes X-ray diagnosis, radiotherapy and nuclear 
medicine. The radiology department should always be 
close to the ambulance entrance and, because of the great 
weight of the equipment (up to 14t), it is sensible to plan 
these areas on the ground or first basement floor. 

The rooms of the individual diagnostic areas must be so 
arranged as to minimise the distance between them. A 
connecting corridor which can be used simultaneously as a 
store, dictating room and, possibly, a switchroom as well as 
for staff circulation, is desirable. The size of the rooms 
depends on their use and what they contain: for example, 
sonography, mammography and jaw X-ray require about 
12-18 m2 whereas standard X-ray and admission rooms 
need to be 20-30 m2. The access route for patients should 
be through two changing cubicles, and a wide door 
(>1250mm) for beds is necessary. WCs should be installed 
in X-ray rooms used for stomach/intestinal inspection. 
Angiography rooms require an auxiliary room with a sink 
and built-in storage (e.g. medicine refrigerator); medical 
gases must be also be available. The admission room for 
computertomography (CT) must be about 35 m2 in area. The 
patients pass through lobbies or changing rooms in order 
to reach the admission room. The switchroom is connected 
by a door and a window. An additional room for switch 
cupboards and film developing is desirable. The walls, 
ceilings and floors must be shielded with lead sheeting, the 
thickness of which depends on the type of equipment to be 
used. Co-operation with the manufacturers of X-ray 
equipment is absolutely essential.

HOSPITALS 


Treatment Areas 


Radiotherapy 

In radiotherapy, conditions diagnosed in the radiography 
department (e.g. tumours) are treated. The radiotherapy 
department comprises a reception and waiting area, 
doctors’ rooms (approximately 18m2), a switchroom 
(15m2), possibly a localisation room (20-25m2), a service 
room (20m2), a film developing room (10m2), stores and a 
cleaners’ room. Each treatment room requires a changing 
cubicle for patients. If the department includes a linear 
accelerator a workshop (15m2) and at least one physics 
laboratory (15-18m2) will also be necessary. The clear 
height of the radiation rooms must be 4.30m. 

For hygiene reasons the patient waiting area, 
examination, localisation, preparation and radiation rooms 
must be well vented and well ventilated (at least five 
changes of air per hour). 

The safety requirements are particularly strict for 
radiotherapy departments and must satisfy all applicable 
national and international regulations. Structural shielding 
from radiation can be achieved by using lead inserts or with 
thick concrete walls (e.g. barite concrete). The thickness of 
walls constructed in concrete only should be 3.00m for 
treatment and examination rooms in the primary radiation 
area and 1.50m for rooms in the secondary radiation area, 
according to the type of equipment. 

The huge weight of the equipment and the required 
structural radiation protection measures make it necessary 
for radiotherapy departments to be located in the basement 
or on the ground floor.

HOSPITALS 
Laboratories; Functional Diagnosis 


Laboratory department 

The laboratory department is concerned mostly with the 
preparation and processing of blood, urine and faecal samples. 
It is often separated from the treatment and nursing areas, the 
connection to the other departments being through a special 
pneumatic tube dispatch system. 

The laboratory itself should be in a large room with built-in 
work surfaces (standing work places) to offer a high level of 
flexibility. Specialist laboratories are added on as separate rooms. 
Subsidiary rooms include rinsing rooms, sluice rooms, 
disinfection rooms, cool rooms, rest rooms and WCs for staff. The 
size of the department depends on the demands of the hospital. 

Sometimes the laboratory departments are completely 
separate and serve a group of several hospitals. 


Functional diagnosis 
Functional diagnosis is playing an increasingly important role in 
hospitals due to advances in heart and thorax research and the 
rising number of patients with heart, lung and circulation 
problems. Flexibility in the design is absolutely essential to 
accommodate the wide range of techniques and equipment 
used in such departments. A direct connection with the 
laboratory department is beneficial, but not essential. A data link 
to the radiology, radiotherapy and surgical departments is 
necessary to allow combined monitoring (e.g. analysis of X-ray 
results together with ongoing assessment of the vital functions). 
All examination rooms must be accessible through a 
patients’ cubicle and, possibly, also a preparation room. Waiting 
rooms must be sympathetically designed because the patients 
are often extremely nervous.

HOSPITALS 


Supplementary Disciplines 


Physiotherapy 

The physiotherapy department contains a ‘wet area’ 
consisting of an exercise pool (approximately 4 x 6m), a 
‘four cell bath’, a ‘butterfly bath’, inhalation rooms, a 
massage bath, hand and foot baths as well as the necessary 
subsidiary rooms. It is, obviously, important to use sSlip- 
resistant tiles in this area. 

The department should be accessed through a main 
reception area and the division between wet and dry areas 
must be obvious. Additional rooms to be planned include 
changing rooms for men and women, wheelchair users’ 
WC, staff and patient WCs, rest rooms, linen stores, waiting 
areas, cleaners’ room and service rooms for the exercise 
pool. 

A gymnasium is often included in the physiotherapy 
department. This will require a clear height of at least 
3.00m, the provision of a sprung floor and the installation 
of impact resistant lighting. Because of the high internal 
temperatures (28-30°) construction physics problems 
should be anticipated. 

Ideally, the physiotherapy rooms should be arranged on 
the basement floor where natural lighting can be admitted 
through roof lights and light shafts. 


Urological treatment 

This discipline is related to X-ray diagnosis. The treatment 
room should be 25-30 m2 in size and it must be close to the 
surgical department. The room should contain an 
examination and treatment table for endoscopic 
investigations and be equipped with a wash-basin, 
suspended irrigator, floor drainage, 4-6volt power points 
(cystoscopy), two changing cubicles and a WC. There 
should also be an instrument room adjoining (roughly 
15m), with sterilisers, sinks and a wash-basin, and a 
patient waiting area. 


Eye treatment 

Eye treatment can be carried out in a room approximately 
25m? in size which can be darkened as required. The 
necessary equipment includes a_ treatment. chair, 
examination and diagnostic instruments, an examination 
couch, a wash-basin and a writing desk. A patients’ waiting 
room should be situated to the front of the treatment room. 


Ear, nose and throat (ENT) treatment 

ENT treatment is carried out for inpatients in their own care 
area. The treatment room (25-30m2), which can be 
darkened, should contain a _ treatment table for 
examinations, a treatment chair, a steriliser, a sink and 
wash-basin, storage spaces for portable equipment, 4-6 volt 
power points and compressed air/suction lines. Adjoining 
the treatment room should be a rest room and a patients’ 
waiting room. 


Dental treatment 

This specialist area of treatment should be provided 
primarily in special ENT and rheumatism clinics. The 
treatment room needs to be 25-30 m2 in size and contain a 
treatment chair with dental unit, a desk, a wash-basin, X-ray 
and anaesthetic equipment, a sink alcove with steriliser 
and, if possible, a darkroom.

DAY CLINICS; OUTPATIENT SURGERY 


a The contracting out of services following health reforms 
has freed space in many hospitals. Much of this has been 
converted into day clinics for patients who are only cared 

for during the day and do not require hospital beds, or who 

have undergone outpatient surgery. As these patients are 

anaesthesia divorced from the rest of the hospital activities, it is 
mee necessary to provide a separate entrance for them. The

escape routes must comply to the hospital regulations and 
so should be discussed with the appropriate officials. 

Outpatient surgeries for minor operations are becoming 
increasingly common. They can either be connected to 
existing hospitals or be completely independent clinics: 
both options seem to be developing in parallel. In a 
hospital, the outpatient surgery should be close to the 
emergency room and the surgical department.

(1) Supply and disposal area: route relationships 


The clinical, nursing and technical supply centre is located 
either in a separate supplies building or at a neutral supplies 
and disposal level under the main building. It is best to have 
a goods yard which is separated from the main and 
ambulance entrances. A north-facing orientation for this 
entrance is ideal. External and internal circulation routes 
must be co-ordinated so that overlaps with the routes used 
by the care and treatment areas are avoided. 

During the design stage, it must be remembered that this 
area of the hospital can create a great deal of noise (goods 
vehicles and machinery) and smells (refuse containers, 
kitchen waste etc.) and so should not be situated close to the 
nursing wing. The planning of the supplies area is arranged 
according to the medical departments of the hospitals. A 
detailed specification can only be devised after the detailed 
design of the nursing and treatment wings has been 
established. The increasing use of automation demands co- 
operation between the architects, specialist engineers and 
manufacturers in the design stages. A tendency towards 
greater centralisation is noticeable, the incentive being to 
keep investment at a minimum and to produce economies in 
staffing. As a result of this, in the case of small clinics, an in- 
house main kitchen and laundry can be dispensed with: 
meals are delivered from a central kitchen and the laundry is 
managed by an external service organisation. 


HOSPITALS 
Supplies Areas 


For goods and materials which are required only by one 
department it is economic to provide a decentralised 
preparation/disposal unit (e.g. for surgical instruments and 
substerilisation, or for developing X-ray film in the X-ray 
diagnostic department). 


Means of transport 

In addition to the organisation of stores and the 
preparation of delivered and reused goods, there is the 
question of transportation. Multipurpose trolleys are 
frequently used for distributing the required items to each 
point of consumption and these can be used at the same 
time for storing equipment. In medium-size and large 
hospitals a vertical conveyor, with selective automated 
discharge, for distribution to the various storeys and 
return of used goods to the non-clean preparation zone is 
necessary in order to relieve personnel. A dispatch 
system using pneumatic tubes, for example, should be 
provided for sending small items such as drugs and 
notes. 

The scale of the transport system depends on the size 
of the institution: the supply and disposal requirement 
per bed per day is 30-35kg. For large or heavy items (e.g. 
beds, respiration equipment, heart and lung machines) 
conventional bed elevators are available. A_ fully 
automatic conveyor system can be used for transporting 
medium-size items (e.g. food, laundry, refuse, consumer 
goods) in large hospitals. 


Central supply 
The advantages of collecting together all of the supplies 
functions on one supply/disposal level are uniform 
overall management, common stock control and the 
utilisation of the same transport systems. Centralisation 
also means there is a single point to which goods are 
delivered; from here, distribution and storage of goods 
can be controlled efficiently. 

For hygiene reasons it is important to separate clean 
and non-clean goods. This is a primary consideration 
when designing transport systems. 


Staff rooms 

In the supplies area, changing and washrooms, WCs, 
cleaning rooms, storage rooms (for cleaning equipment) 
and rest rooms must be provided in the immediate 
vicinity of the goods inward/collection point. 


Sterilisation 

Since it is primarily items for the surgical department 
which are prepared in the central sterilisation unit, the 
two should be situated close together. However, to meet 
immediate needs, the surgical department will have its 
own substerilisation facilities. The central store for drugs 
and instruments must be closely linked to the central 
sterilisation unit. 


Dispensary 

In institutions without a full pharmacy, medication 
requiring approval is distributed from the dispensary. 
This consists of a work and dispensing room (25m42) 
which is accessed directly from the main circulation 
corridor. It is fitted out with a desk, washing facility, sink, 
weighing station and lockable cupboards. Adjoining are a 
dry store and proprietary medicines store (15m2), a cold 
store (10m2) for hazardous substances, a dressing 
materials room and a damp store in accordance with fire 
regulations. When planning new buildings, it is 
recommended that a full pharmacy be included in the 
design.

HOSPITALS 
Supplies Areas 


Pharmacy 
In medium-size and large hospitals the pharmacy stocks 
prescriptions and carries out examinations under the 
management of an accredited pharmacist. In the design the 
following rooms are necessary: dispensary, materials room, 
drug store, laboratory and, possibly, an issue desk. If 
necessary, also include herb and dressing materials rooms, 
demijohn and acid cellar, and a room in which night duty 
personnel can sleep. The dispensary and laboratory should 
contain a prescription table, a work table, a packing table 
and a sink. The storage of inflammable liquids and acids, as 
well as various anaesthetics, means appropriate safety 
measures are stipulated for the walls, ceilings and doors. 
The pharmacy must be close to lifts and the pneumatic 
tube dispatch system. 


Central bed unit 

From the point of view of hygiene and economy, every 
hospital should contain a bed unit, in which the appropriate 
staff strip down, clean, disinfect and make up the beds. A 
complete bed change is required for new admissions, 
patients after 14 days as an inpatient, after operations and 
deliveries, as well as after serious soiling. The size of the 
bed unit depends on the number of nursing beds in the 
hospital: for about 500 inpatients a bed unit for 70 beds 
should be provided. The functional demarcation requires a 
clean and non-clean side, separated by the bed cleaning 
room, mattress disinfecting room and staff lobby. For 
carrying out repairs, a special workshop, approximately 
35 m2, should be situated in the close vicinity, as should the 
laundry and store for clean bedding, mattresses etc. If 
machines are to be used to clean the bed frames and 
mattresses, the specific requirements of the equipment 
must be taken into account at an early stage (e.g. demands 
for floor recesses, clear heights). 


Laundry provision 

Figures for the amount of dirty dry washing generated per 
bed per day vary between 0.8 and 3.0kg. The following 
sequence of work is preferred in the laundry: receipt, 
sorting, weighing, washing, spinning, beating out, 
mangling or drying (tumble dryer), pressing (if possible 
high pressure steam connection), ironing, sewing, storage, 
issue. The laundry hall consists of a sorting and weighing 
area (15m?), laundry collection room under laundry chutes 
from the wards, wet working area (50 m2), dry working area 
(60m), detergent store (10m2), sewing room (10m2) and 
laundry store (15m2). 


Meal provision 
Providing the patients with proper nutrition places high 
demands on food preparation since the required amounts 
of protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, fibre and 
flavourings often vary. The dominant food provision 
systems are those which rationalise the individual phases 
of conventional food preparation (preparatory work, 
making up, transporting, distribution). Preparation of 
normal food and special diets takes place separately. After 
preparation and cooking the meals are put together on the 
portioning line. The portioned trays are transported with 
the supply trolleys to the various stations for distribution. 
The same trolleys are used to transport the used crockery 
back to the central washing up and trolley cleaning unit. 
Staff catering consists of about 40% of the total catering 
demand. The staff dining room should be close to the 
central kitchen. A division into separate rooms for domestic 
staff, nurses, clerical staff and doctors could be considered 
in a large hospital but, again, for economic reasons, these 
rooms must be near to the main kitchen. For small and 
medium-size hospitals this type of division is not 
recommended.

HOSPITALS 
Supplies Areas 


Central kitchen: Historically, kitchens were on the top floor to 
reduce the smell and noise. Today they are positioned on the 
same level as supplies to give an efficient working process: 
delivery, storage, preparation, making up and dispatch. When 
deep-frozen food is used, the set-up of the kitchen changes. 
Here the architect and users must co-operate closely to 
optimise the meal preparation process and find an 
advantageous, space-saving solution. The clear height of the 
kitchen hall should be 4.00m. The size of the kitchen depends 
on the requirements and number of patients in the hospital. In 
the main kitchen an area of 1.00m2 is needed per person. A 
special-diet kitchen (60m? minimum) should also be planned, 
with a desk for the head chef, a 30m? vegetable cleaning area 
and a 5m? provision for waste disposal. In addition, the plan 
must include a daily supplies room (8m2), a cold store with 
compartments for meat, fish and dairy products (8m? each) and 
a pre-cooling store (10m2) with a chest freezer and cooling unit. 
The goods delivery area should be connected to administration 
and have sufficient storage space (15-20m2). The main store 
should hold fruit and vegetables (20m2), dry goods (20m?) and 
tinned goods/preserves, and must be adjoining. 


Central washing-up unit: The central washing-up unit, 
adjacent to the central kitchen, stores and cleans the staff and 
patients’ dishes. The high level of automation makes it 
essential for the designer, at an early stage, to clarify and 
conform to the specific requirements of the individual pieces 
of equipment. 


Technical supplies: The technical service is responsible for 
technical supplies and plays an increasingly important role as 
more automation is introduced. Tasks include building 
maintenance, domestic technology, medical technology, 
conveyor technology and administration. 

It should be noted that sanitary installations are the subject 
of rapid technical development. It is advantageous to have 
ring circuits for the horizontal supplies on each storey and 
rising supplies in separate ducts for vertical connections. The 
horizontal supply pipes should be installed in the voids above 
suspended ceilings to make subsequent alterations easy. 
Water is treated centrally; only areas with higher quality 
requirements (pharmacy) have local water preparation 
(desalination, softening). Water consumption is calculated at 
400-450 | of water per hospital bed per day, depending on the 
type and situation of the hospital. Note that waste water is 
subject to local regulations. 


Ventilation and gases: The ventilation equipment is best 
situated near to the open air. During planning, the horizontal 
and vertical ventilation ducts should be tested against 
technical fire protection criteria. 

It is necessary to provide medical gases for the surgical, 
intensive care and radiology departments, and special supply 
rooms are required. The pumps for oxygen, carbon dioxide, 
vacuum and compressed air should be duplicated so as to 
provide a backup in case of failure. An additional technical 
requirement is an emergency electrical supply system. 


Central heating unit: Earlier systems, using a boiler room, 
required large basement areas (>100m4), generaliy on two 
storeys. Current heating systems are less area-intensive and 
district heating is particularly advantageous. Note that the 
surgical and intensive care departments must have a 
continuous heat supply so emergency systems must 
therefore be planned. The heating system and medical 
services supply/emergency power unit may be 
accommodated in one large room. The layout requirements 
for services (water, electricity, gas etc.) and flues are laid down 
in regulations and these must be observed. Emergency 
escape doors must open outwards. 

If possible, the ‘heat store’ (and entry to it) should be 
situated underground, outside the building. Note that there 
are building and heating room regulations which apply.

HOSPITALS 
Supplies Areas 


In recent years increasing use has been made of modern 
Organisational models. The central organisation of individual 
supply and disposal areas alleviates the problem of increasing 
staff shortages. Internal central supply routes are separated from 
the other traffic flows in the hospital and external disruption is 
avoided, allowing optimum use of the transport system's 
capacity. Computer simulation programs can show the architect 
efficient operational sequences (which can still be modified 
throughout the planning phase) and setting utilisation targets 
allows the space required in the supplies area to be minimised. 


Electrical systems 

The power supply is taken from the national grid: 220-240V 
standard voltage and 380V high voltage. The low voltage 
system is controlled from the distributor room which requires at 
least two free-standing transformer cell units. Sufficiently wide 
doors (at least 1.30m clear width) and good ventilation must be 
provided and all relevant VDE and professional association 
regulations must be complied with. The size and number of 
emergency power units depends on the size of the hospital and 
local plants for individual functional units (surgical/outpatients 
department, care areas, radiology) are preferable to a central 
emergency power system. Anti-vibration foundations should be 
used underneath these units to reduce noise. Additional 
batteries must be provided for lighting and emergency power in 
the surgical department. 


Central gas supply 

Oxygen and nitrogen lines are supplied from steel cylinders, 
alternating between operating and reserve batteries with an 
automatic changeover facility. To reduce the distance that these 
cylinders need to be transported, direct access to the goods 
yard is preferred. The cylinders may be stored with the medical 
services pumps (for vacuum and compressed air lines) at a 
central supply point (possibly computer-controlled). Gas 
cylinders are beginning to be replaced by ‘cold gasifiers’. These 
must stand in the open air at least 5m from buildings. 


Workshops 

Connected to the goods yard are metalwork and electrical 
workshops (40m2), with a materials store, spare parts store 
(20m2), general store (60m2) and standing area for transport 
equipment (15m2). A water reservoir (emergency water tank) 
should be planned for, possibly at the elevator crossings over 
the top storey (40m3). Water treatment plant for the general 
hospital and the sterilisation area must be separated. 


Communications centre 

The following information and communications media could be 
needed in the hospital: telephones and faxes, intercom 
systems, nurse call system, clocks, pagers, a PA system for 
music and announcements, television, telex, radio. For a better 
overview, a central point should be set up for co-ordinating 
these media (in the entrance hall or in a room off reception). 
Pagers are to be provided in parallel with the telephone network 
where it is not feasible to reach a telephone for time or 
operational reasons (e.g. surgical area, radiology). The nurse 
intercom system allows a voice link between individual nurses’ 
workrooms and the patients’ rooms. Several hundred clocks 
with a second hand can be controlled from a quartz battery 
clock via the telephone network. Patients’ rooms are to be 
equipped with telephone, telephone paging and television. In 
teaching and research hospitals it is important to have closed- 
circuit television (monitoring). All buildings must be monitored 
by an automatic fire alarm system, supplemented with manual 
alarm switches. In the event of fire, the ventilation system, 
transport systems and elevators are controlled via the fire alarm 
system. Consultation with specialist engineers is essential. 


Bunkers 

The requirements of structures providing protection from 
radioactive fall-out and air attack vary from country to country 
so the local guidelines must be followed. In Switzerland, for 
example, an auxiliary operating theatre, wards, sterile goods 
store and emergency technical systems must be provided.

Archive and store rooms 

A short route between archives and work areas is advantageous 
but generally difficult to provide. One possibility is to locate 
them in the basement and have a link by stairs. Distinctions 
should be made between store and archive rooms for files, 
documentation and film from administration, the X-ray 
department etc. and supplies (pharmacy, disinfection, kitchen 
etc.) and equipment (kitchen, administration, workshops etc.). 
The necessary depth of shelves and cupboards depends on the 
goods stored. For files, books and film, 250-400mm is 
adequate; for equipment, china spare parts etc., 400-600mm is 
needed. Mobile shelving systems are useful for reducing the 
floor area occupied. The high loads imposed by shelves (up to 
1000 kg/m2) must be taken into account from an early stage. 


Communal rooms 

Dining rooms and cafeteria are best situated on the ground 
floor, or on the top floor to give a good view, must have a direct 
connection to the servery. The connection to the central kitchen 
is by goods lift, which is not accessible to visitors. Consider 
whether it is sensible to separate visitors, staff and patients. 
Nowadays, the dining areas are often run by external caterers 
and the self-service system (servery 6-8m) has become 
generally accepted. Salad counters should = stand 
independently. 


Prayer rooms 

These should, preferably, occupy a central location, at the 
intersection of internal and external circulation routes, but 
outside the care, treatment and supply areas. This allows access 
for employees, visitors and inpatients. The size of devotional 
rooms and the facilities they offer will vary according to faith, 
place and person, but they are often not oriented towards a 
particular faith. At least 40 m2 should be allocated. 

In large hospitals, it might possibly be desirable to include a 
chapel, in which case the relevant church authorities should be 
consulted. (See the section entitled Places of Worship for details 
of the requirements.) 

When planning rooms to cater for spiritual needs in 
hospitals, it is essential to consider space requirements for 
wheelchair users and those who are bedridden.

Administration rooms 

Rooms for administration should be connected by corridor to 
the entrance hall and be close to the main circulation routes. A 
suitable route to the supplies area must also be planned.

source: German Hospital Association (DKG), issued 1997 


The following requirements are based on a one hundred-bed 
occupancy level. In the administrative area, 7-12m2 per member 
of staff should be planned. Rooms for dealings with patients and 
relatives need to be connected to reception (entrance hall), 
admissions and accounts (25m2). Links to the casualty entrance 
are also important, and there should be at least two reception 
areas (each 5m2) for demarcation before the main reception, the 
cash-desk (12m2) and accounts (12m2). 

Additional rooms needed include: an office for the 
administrative director (20m2), a secretarial room (10m2), an 
administrators’ office (15m2, possibly in the supply area), a 
nurses’ office (20m2), a personnel office (25m2) and central 
archives (40m2, possibly in the basement with a link to the 
administration department via stairs). 

According to requirements, the plan should also provide: duty 
rooms for matron and welfare workers, a doctors’ staff room and 
consulting rooms, a messenger room, a medical records archive, 
specialist and patients’ libraries, and a hairdresser’s room (with 
two seats). 

The increasing rationalisation of accounts and the use of 
electronic systems and computers should be taken into 
consideration during planning (e.g. cableways in floors — 
possibly, raised floors — central desk with tube post link etc.). 


Main entrance 

General traffic goes only to the main entrance; for hygiene 
reasons (e.g. risk of infection), special entrances are to be shown 
separately. The entrance hall, on the basis of the open-door 
principle, should be designed as a waiting room for visitors. 
Today's layouts are more like that of a modern hotel foyer, having 
moved away from the typical hospital character. The size of the 
hall depends on bed capacity and the expected number of visitors. 
Circulation routes for visitors, patients and staff are separated 
from the hall onwards. The reception and telephone switchboard 
(12m2) are formed using counters, allowing staff to supervise 
more effectively. However, it must be possible to prevent public 
access from reception to inner areas and main staff circulation 
routes. The entrance hall should also contain pay phones and a 
kiosk selling tobacco, sweets, flowers and writing materials. 


Casualty entrance 

A covered access road or closed hall overlooked by the 
administration department, but not visible from the main 
entrance, is preferred for incoming casualty patients. Short 
routes to outpatients, the surgical/X-ray departments and the 
wards should be planned and these must be free of general 
traffic. An examination room for first aid (15m2), a washroom 
(15m2), an ante-room (10m2), standing room for at least two 
stretchers, and a laundry store should be included in an area 
where they are accessible directly beyond the entrance.

HOSPITALS 
Teaching and Research 


Residential area 

The residential areas are, without exception, separated 
from the main hospital but reached via the access road for 
the entire site. The area is divided into residential homes, 
apartments and training schools. There must be sufficient 
parking spaces for vehicles belonging to the employees. 

In addition to nurses, residential homes for female 
employees should also accommodate female doctors, 
assistant physicians, auxiliary staff and students, if 
necessary. Bedsitting rooms should be designed uniformly 
as single rooms with a cupboard and wash-basin (16 m2) or, 
preferably, with a separate WC/shower area. The usual 
dimensions of the rooms are approximately 
4.60-4.75m x 3.00-3.50m. The storey height of standard 
residential buildings is adequate. 

Opinions on the arrangement of kitchen units vary. 
Previously, the norm was 10-12 bedsitting rooms in a 
residential group sharing a kitchen (6m2), lounge (20m2), 
possibly a balcony, and a cleaning room (10m2). Today 
bedsitting rooms with an integrated cooking area and en- 
Suite facilities are usual (see the section covering student 
halls of residence). Common rooms for all employees are 
one lounge (1.0m2 per bedsitting room: 20m2 minimum), 
connecting with a multipurpose room (20m2), a cloakroom, 
WCs, a laundry room (10m2), a drying room (15m2) and a 
Storage room (30m2). Similar residential homes for male 
employees should be in the design unless the size of the 
hospital necessitates a common residential home. 


Apartments 

Doctors should be housed in two-room apartments (40 m2) 
in separate male and female residential blocks. Three- and 
four-room apartments (70-90 m2) away from these blocks 
should also be planned for doctors, hospital administrators 
and house masters. Communal rooms may be arranged for 
doctors if necessary: library and reading room (25m2), club 
room (35m). The proportion of apartments for doctors is 
currently growing smaller. 


Training schools 

To provide practical experience, a specific area in close 
contact with the hospital is required for training medical 
students, teaching and _ research. Increasing student 
numbers are making greater demands on training schools. 
The following must be provided: stores, workshops, 
experimental stations (pharmacy), audiovisual facilities for 
video transmissions from the Surgical department, possibly 
a separate cafeteria, lecture theatres (150-500 seats), a 
library, research and teaching laboratories, practice rooms 
and office space. The number and size of all rooms depend 
on the scale and location of the institution. 


Experimental stations 

This is where all laboratory animals are kept and is an area 
of particular importance in university hospitals. The 
experimental station is connected to other laboratory areas 
by passenger and goods lift. Large additional areas must be 
planned for the breeding and keeping of animals. 


Library 

Medical libraries should be designed as open-shelf 
libraries, with no closed stores and no requirement for 
issuing books. A large part of the literature will be made up 
of periodicals. It is important to have an adequate number 
of reading tables with reading lamps, workstations with 
microfiche readers, slide viewers and typewriters. It is 
advantageous if the library is connected to the small or 
medium-size transportation systems of the hospital.

A&E AND OUTPATIENTS DEPARTMENT 


Accident and emergency (A&E) 

The accident and emergency department is for ambulant and 
bedridden patients and is accessed via the emergency entrance 
(note that the minimum vehicie headroom is 3.50m). Clear 
signposting to the drive-in entrance is of life-saving importance 
for ambulance drivers. It is convenient to site this entrance on the 
opposite side of the building to the main entrance to avoid 
contact with the visitors and other patients. 

The accident and emergency department consists of 
emergency treatment rooms (20-25m2) equipped with operating 
tables, small operating lights, cupboard units with sinks, and 
patient cubicles. In addition, a plaster room with plastering bench 
and equipment and a shock treatment and recovery room must 
be available. 

Proximity to the surgical department is essential, even if a 
special intervention room for emergencies Is included in the plan, 
and surgery and anaesthesia services should also be grouped 
nearby. 


Casualty hospitals 

These are generally found only in cities and often also serve 
rehabilitation purposes. Such auxiliary hospitals, with a well- 
trained surgical department, are often accommodated in old 
genera! hospitals which have been moved to new buildings. 


Public health offices 
In Germany these generally perform the functions of an 
Outpatients clinic; they provide the outlet for preventive 
measures and follow-up treatment of ambulant patients who 
have been discharged. 
Typical facilities in an outpatient clinic are as follows: 
® examination and treatment rooms are needed for initial 
diagnosis, preliminary treatment, follow-up treatment and 
consultations, etc., all with separate waiting rooms 
@ office rooms should be provided for doctors co-ordinating, 
for example, strategies for combating epidemics and these 
should have ante-rooms (e.g. for records, inoculations 
etc.) as well as a separate waiting room 
® venereal disease treatment requires examination rooms 
(with WCs), ante-rooms for patient records and medication 
etc., and waiting rooms 
e infant welfare services should have a waiting room, a 
nursing room and ample space for prams (at the entrance), 
materials and records 
In addition, plans must include medical-technical rooms, X-ray 
departments, rooms for administrators and personnel, and 
rooms for storage and archiving. 
The size of all of these rooms varies and needs to be agreed 
between the planner and the users.

and new babies following a hospital delivery. After 
uncomplicated births, the care of new mothers can be 
considered part of normal care. However, new mothers with 
highly infectious diseases, such as typhoid, TB and 
hepatitis, need to be housed in an isolation care ward. 
Where vital functions are disrupted, provision should be 
made for easy transfer to the intensive care ward. Neonates 
with infections or respiratory difficulties (e.g. premature 
babies) have to be transferred to special departments or the 
nearest children’s hospital. 

The division of maternity care is the same as for normal 
care: basic care, treatment care, patient care, administration 
and supply. Organisation of the processes with the options 
of ward care, group care or individual care are also the 
same as for normal care. With centralised neonatal 
provision, the care unit for neonates is located at the side of 
or within the maternity care unit. To reduce infection, the 
area is divided into small rooms or compartments. 
Neonates are carried into the mother’s room on trolleys or 
by hand for breast feeding. This achieves more frequent 
and more intensive contact between mother and child than 
in previous designs with central feeding rooms. 
Accommodating mothers and neonates in one room 
(‘rooming in’) means the infants do not need to be moved, 
which thus relieves the staff, but requires uneconomic local 
neonatal provision. Despite this, it has become standard 
practice in some hospitals. 


Facilities and size of care units 

They are generally smaller than the units in normal care 
areas. Smaller wards are preferable because they are easier 
to control in terms of hygiene (less movement of staff and 
visitors) so it is advisable to limit the size per care unit to 
10-14 bed spaces. The functions may be divided into: care 
of healthy mothers, care of healthy neonates, care of special 
neonates (e.g. premature babies) and incidental functions. 
For hygiene reasons, higher demands are to be made on 
maternal and neonatal care than on normal care. Therefore, 
a visitors’ lobby and cloakroom area must be provided in 
addition to the usual system of demarcation. The bed space 
can be planned as in normal care but the bed spacing must 
be increased to allow space for a baby’s crib next to the 
beds. Sit-bath/shower combinations and showers must be 
provided in the sanitary zones where mothers should not 
take full baths in tubs. 

The neonatal care units comprise: bed spaces for 
neonates, undressing/dressing areas, baby bathing, 
weighing point, children’s nurses’ duty station and, 
possibly, a trolley standing area. A special neonatal care 
unit with isolated beds and care points should be provided 
for babies with pathogenic conditions. The following 
elements or rooms are also to be included in an incidental 
function area: duty station for the ward sister, nurses’ 
lounge, kitchenette, doctors’ offices, examination and 
treatment room, clean workroom, patient bathroom, day- 
rooms for patients and visitors, storage space for 
equipment and cleaning materials, staff and visitors’ WCs, 
linen cupboards and a room for consultation with relatives. 


Environment 

To minimise the transfer of airborne germs, the ventilation 
system must process eight changes of air per hour. The room 
temperatures must be between 24°C and 26°C. 


Position 

The transport route for new mothers and neonates after 
delivery should be as short as possible and not cross any 
other busy corridors. Obstetrics and maternity care should 
preferably be on one level to avoid the need to use lifts.

records Hospital logistics should be centred in one place. A service 
yard, conveniently situated in a low-level supplies and 
disposal area, makes this possible. The supply and disposal 
of all hospital goods and materials is conducted via a 
separate road connection, segregated from the main and 
emergency entrances. During planning, consideration must 
be given not just to the parking and manoeuvring area for 
goods vehicles, but also to the wide variety of waste to be 
managed (kitchen, septic, metal, glass, paper, chemicals 

etc.) and the necessary storage requirements. In addition,

SPECIAL CARE AREA SAFETY 


Infants and children 

The patients generally found in special children’s hospitals may 
be categorised as follows: infants (35%) and premature babies 
(13%), small children and schoolchildren up to the age of 14 
(22%), and groups of all ages with infectious diseases (22%). In 
such areas, contact between the patients and other 
patients/staff should be avoided as far as possible. 

Windows, heaters and electrical apparatus must be secured 
in such a way that children cannot be put at risk. Rooms for 
teaching, entertainment and play should be similarly fitted out. 

Isolation wards must be provided for measles, chickenpox, 
diphtheria, scarlet fever and TB. The walls must withstand 
washing and disinfecting below a height of 1.50m and the 
design should as far as possible resemble a kindergarten rather 
than a clinical area. 


Care of patients receiving radiotherapy 

When planning a care area using nuclear medicine for patients 
needing radiotherapy, the provisions of radiation protection 
regulations must be observed. The size of such care groups 
should be similar to that of a normal care group. The operations 
centre is divided into a control area and a supervision area. In 
this way, patients whose bodies have received the greatest 
radiation doses are separated from those who have received 
less. Patients should therefore be accommodated primarily in 
One-bed rooms. 


Care of the mentally ill 

The variable nature of mental illness results in a requirement 
for open and closed wards (for those in need of slight care and 
those who are seriously ill and possibly violent). The two types 
need to be accommodated when planning and setting up care 
units. Large areas are required for day-rooms, dining rooms 
and rooms for occupational and group therapy, because 
patients are not confined to bed. Small care units (up to 25 
patients) should have short circulation routes and provide good 
observation points for nursing staff. A homely design should 
always be used to give patients a feeling of well-being. There is 
a trend towards integrating wards for the mentally ill into 
general hospitals to prevent these patients becoming 
institutionalised.

CHURCHES 


In larger churches or cathedrals (the seat of the bishop), 
side chapels with ancillary altars may be built. The chancel 
should be slightly raised for good visibility, and suitably set 
off from other areas. As well as the altar, a table is required 
for the missal (Gospels) and the vessels, and also a seat for 
the priest and servers (not a throne), usually at the vertex of 
the altar facing the congregation. A fixed lectern (ambo) is 
also necessary. The sermon (homily) and intercessions 
should be given from the right as seen by the congregation. 
Va Communion benches are no longer obligatory. Side altars 
in Roman Catholic churches are movable or in lockable 
recesses 2>2.00m wide and 3m deep. 
The nave should have benches for worshippers to sit and

CHURCH ORGANS 


The organ in a church or concert hall is a work of art 
incorporating musical, architectural and technical aspects. 
There is no fixed form. The design is based on the technical 
requirements of the organ, and each organ is unique. The organ 
is an integral part of a space and of the architecture. The space 
and the organ must be planned together. At the beginning of 
the planning process, the architect and the organ builder should 
work together. The problems are complex and cannot be solved 
by the architect alone. The external appearance of the organ 
should match its inner structure. The factors affecting this are 
the volume of the space, the acoustics of the space, the position 
within the space, the number of seats and the musical 
requirements (solo instrument, accompaniment). The better the

ipe arrangement on wind : : ; 
chast smaller the organ needs to be. The optimum reverberation time 
swell organ casing is 3-4 seconds in a full space with high diffusion and good 
\ = reflection from the rear wall, the side walls and the ceiling. The 


frequency range of an organ is between 16Hz and over 
10000Hz. The sound is better in front of, rather than behind, the 
organ. The sound in any space is best on the main/longitudinal 
axis. The units for determining musical capacity are register and 
number of stops > @2. In small spaces, one register requires 
60m3, medium-sized spaces require 100m per register and 
larger spaces 150m<°. If the acoustics for the organ are not good

CHURCH ORGANS 


The console should be firmly connected to the organ when 
using a mechanical action. This is the only way to ensure 
short actions and an optimum touch. Electric actions (direct 
electric and electro-pneumatic) allow the console to be 
placed as far from the pipes as required, but normally the 
console is built into the front of the organ. In the case of a 
prospect organ, the console can be positioned to the side, 
but only rarely behind the organ. 

A free-standing console must be in a central position in 
front of the organ, at a maximum distance of 2.00m. The 
organist should be facing the instrument (> 570 @3)- (4). The 
mechanical devices connecting the console to the wind 
chest of the organ are called actions. They should be short 
and simple. The bellows consist of a blower, reservoirs and

resonate with the frequency of the bells. 

The weight, alloy and thickness of the bell walls determine 
the volume of sound. Today, electric ringing machines are often 
used. Steel bells are about 15% larger in diameter and about 
25% lighter than bronze bells, but are rarely manufactured

SYNAGOGUES 


God's first commission for a sacred building, with exact technical 
and design specifications, can be found in the passage in the Bible 
describing the construction of the Tabernacle (Exodus 25-27). 

The focal point in a synagogue is not an altar but a raised 
preaching rostrum (almemor) with seats for the rabbi and the 
cantor. Extracts from the Torah are read from here. The 
synagogue is sited to face Jerusalem. On the front wall is an ark 
in which the Torah scrolls are kept (Aron Hakodesh). The ark and 
its contents are the holiest features in the synagogue. It is in one 
single section in the ‘Askenasi’ part of the world (European Jews), 
and in three sections in Sephardic areas (oriental Jews). Between 
the almemor and the Aron Hakodesh is an aisle used for the 
ceremonial procession preceding the reading from the scrolls. 

The plan of every new synagogue is an attempt to solve anew 
the problems of the locations of the spiritual focal point, which is 
the almemor (i.e. a more orthodox, centralised building), and the 
spatial focal point, which is the Aron Hakodesh (i.e. a more 
modern long hall). The symbolic elements of the star of David, 
the seven-branched candelabrum and the Decalogue given to 
Moses are also essential. 

A pulpit has been included in some synagogue interiors since 
at least the fifth or sixth century, but they were not commonplace 
until the eighth century. It is used for reading texts less holy than 
those read at the bimah table, and for offering prayers. It is likely 
to be a modest piece of furniture with only occasional 
ornamentation. 

A synagogue may be surrounded by other annexes and 
buildings. It may even be part of a multi-synagogue complex, as 
at the Great Synagogue courtyard in Vilnius. The synagogue is 
often part of a community centre, thus combining spaces for 
assembly and prayer. There is usually (at least symbolically) a 
separate space for women out of view of the men, often in a 
gallery. At the entrance there is a fountain or washstand for hand 
washing. The ritual bath (mikva), with immersion for women, is 
usually in the cellar. It should have natural running water which 
has not passed through metal pipes. Some liberal synagogues 
and Reform temples have organs, but they are never show- 
pieces. 

The decorations in a synagogue may not contain depictions of 
human beings; only plants or geometrical or calligraphic 
ornamentation is allowed.

MOSQUES 


The five basic categories of mosque design occur in seven 
distinctive regional styles. In the Arabian heartland, Spain and 
North Africa there is a hypostyle hall and an open courtyard. In 
sub-Saharan West Africa the hypostyle hall is of mud-brick or 
rammed-earth construction. Iran and Central Asia have a bi- 
axial four-iwan style. On the Indian subcontinent there are triple 
domes and an extensive courtyard. In Anatolia there is always 
| po See a massive central dome. The Chinese style has detached 
pavilions within a walled garden enclosure, and South-East 

as People at prayer Asia has a central pyramidal roof construction. 

The mosque (masjid or jamih) is a house of prayer, a cultural 
centre, a place for social gatherings, a courthouse, a school and 
a university. (In Islam, the Quran is the central source of all rules 
for living and teaching, and for the pronouncements of law, 
religion etc.) 

In Islamic countries the mosque is in the bazaar (souk), and 
thus in the centre of public life. In countries where the amenities 
of the bazaar (hairdressers, shops selling permitted foods, cafés 
etc.) do not exist, they should be included in the planning of the

heard five times a day resounding from the minaret, which has 
Stairs or a lift leading to the upper ambulatory, which is usually 
covered. Nowadays the call to prayer is virtually always relayed 
by loudspeakers, although this is not permitted in some 
countries. 

The size of the prayer hall is based on 0.85m2 praying space 
per person. It is usually rectangular or square, often with a 
central dome, and faces Mecca, the direction in which people 
pray (kibla). The prayer niche (mihrab) is set in the front wall 
(kibla) and next to it is the minbar (pulpit), which must always 
have an odd number of stairs. This is used by the prayer leader 
of the mosque (the Imam) in the Friday prayers. Men and 
women are segregated, sometimes purely symbolically, 
sometimes with the women in a gallery. 

The entrance area has shelves for the school, and rooms for 
ritual ablutions and showers which must always have a flowing 
water supply. The WCs are usually squatting closets at right 
angles to the direction of Mecca. All these facilities often have 
separate entrances for men and women, including the stairs to

and verses from the Quran in Arabic calligraphy, are very 
popular and have been developed into a form of high culture.

<< allowance

CEMETERIES AND CREMATORIA 


Corpses are initially laid out in cubicles in a mortuary. These 
cubicles are separated by partitions to ensure privacy for 
mourning relatives, who can view the body through airtight 
glass panes up until the funeral. The linking gangway is 
generally for use by both the mourners and the bearers 
although in larger mortuaries separate gangways may be 
used - (3)- (6). Usual dimensions of cubicles are 2.20 x 3.50, 
2.50 x 3.75 and 3.00 x 3.50m. 

The temperature in the mortuary should be maintained 
between 2° to 12°C and it must not be allowed to fall below 
the minimum figure because freezing would result in 
expansion of the internal moisture, possibly causing the 
corpses to burst. This temperature range must be 
maintained by central heating and cooling and constant 
ventilation, particularly in summer. Floors must be 
impervious, smooth and easy to clean; walls are best lime- 
washed and should be re-coated frequently. 

Larger mortuaries also need a room for attendants and 
bearers (roughly 15-20 m2 in size, including toilets and 
washing facilities) and space for the coffin trolleys should 
also be provided. Coffin sizes are variable, depending on 
the size of the corpse > (1), but the trolleys are generally 
2.20x 1.08 to 3.00 1.10m in size. In city mortuaries a special 
room may be set aside for unidentified bodies, with storage 
for their clothing and an adjacent post-mortem room and 
doctor’s surgery > (8). 

The furnace room should either be on a floor below the 
chapel, with lift for coffins = ©) or behind the chapel and 
separated from it by a lobby > ( + ®. Horizontal movement 
of coffins can easily be done by hand-operated winches. The 
door to the lobby or the floor trap should close slowly as the 
coffin gradually disappears through the opening. 

In the furnace room the coffin is transferred from a 
trolley to the chamotte grating inside the furnace. A two- 
storey furnace is roughly 4.30m high and may use either 
electricity (approximately 45kW per cremation), coke or gas 
to carry out the combustion. Cremation is a completely 
dust-free and odourless process achieved by surrounding 
the body with dry air at 900-1000°C dry; flames do not 
touch the body. After the furnace has been pre-heated for 
2-3 hours in advance, the cremation itself takes 11/4 to 11/2 
hours and is monitored through peep-holes. The ashes are 
collected in an iron box before being transferred to an urn. 
The size of urns is often limited by cemetery regulations. 
Wall niches in columbaria are usually 38-40 cm wide and 
deep and 50-60cm high. 

These installations should if possible be behind the 
cemetery chapel, which is non-denominational. For this 
reason there are two rooms for clergy. The size of the 
chapel varies, but should seat at least 100 people and have 
standing room for a further 100. Around the chapel there 
will be a need for waiting rooms for relatives, administration 
rooms, coffin and equipment stores and, possibly, flats for 
the cemetery keeper and caretaker. 

In Britain, crematoria are now being built by the private 
sector. They are always surrounded by a garden for the 
dispersal of ashes. Urns, niches and miniature graves are 
often available in a compact memorial garden to provide a 
temporary memorial (5-10 years).

CEMETERIES AND GRAVEYARDS 


There is a distinction between churchyards and cemeteries. 
In Britain, for example, the growth of churchyards was slow 
and gradual; each year the graves of a few parishioners 
were added until the churchyard was exhausted. Burials 
were then made using old graves. Cemeteries, on the other 
hand, came into existence during the nineteenth century 
with the aim of solving problems caused by large numbers 
of people coming into towns and cities to find work. The 
need for new cemeteries is always dealt with by local 
authorities rather than the church and kept extremely 
simple for maintenance reasons. 

The site should have soil that is easy to dig (clay or 
sandy) and be well drained, with a ground water level 
22.50-3.00m deep. If necessary, drainage should be 
provided. Attractive surroundings are preferable. 

The space requirement is approximately 40 hectares, 
including paths and open spaces, per 100000 inhabitants 
although many existing cemeteries are smaller than this, 
particularly in cities. Of this 50-65% is purely for graves and 
urns, the rest for buildings, paths and gardens. In Britain, 
roughly 70% of dead bodies are cremated; the rest are 
buried in graveyards. The size and length of use of graves 
as specified in cemetery regulations vary greatly.

Military or war cemeteries and memorials 

These are usually reserved for the burial of servicemen and 
soldiers who die during the wars, and for their 
commemoration. Two examples of well-maintained 
military cemeteries in Britain are at Cambridge and 
Aldershot. At Cambridge, the American Government 
established its own cemetery for its servicemen who died in 
Europe during and after the Second World War. At 
Aldershot, British Soldiers have been buried since the 
middle of last century. The American cemetery is on flat 
ground, whereas Aldershot is on hilly ground, which gives 
it the look of a pleasant park. 


Graveyards as parks 
Many village churchyards and a few churchyards in the 
centres of towns have become small parks. They have 
benches, lawns and established trees to provide shade and 
a relaxing environment. 


Gravestones 

In any section of graves surrounded by a hedge the 
gravestones should all be flat or standing and as far as 
possible of uniform colour and size (see examples below).
