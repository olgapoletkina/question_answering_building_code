CHAPTER 1
SCOPE AND ADM IN ISTRATION
User no tes:
About this chapter: Chapter 1 establishes the limits of applicability of the code and describes how the code is to be applied and enforced.
Chapter 1 is in two parts: Part 1—Scope and Application (Sections 101–102) and Part 2—Administration and Enforcement (Sections 103–
116). Section 101 identifies which buildings and structures come under its purview and references other I-Codes as applicable. Standards and
codes are scoped to the extent referenced (see Section 102.4).
This code is intended to be adopted as a legally enforceable document and it cannot be effective without adequate provisions for its adminis?tration and enforcement. The provisions of Chapter 1 establish the authority and duties of the code official appointed by the authority having
jurisdiction and also establish the rights and privileges of the design professional, contractor and property owner. Chapter 1 is largely con?cerned with maintaining “due process of law” in enforcing the building performance criteria contained in the body of the code.
Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the Administrative Code Development Commit?tee during the 2019 (Group B) Code Development Cycle. See explanation on page iv.

Division 1 .4 . Explosives that pose a minor explosion
hazard. The explos ive effects are largely confined to
the package and no pro j ection of fragments of apprecia?ble s ize or range is to be expected. An external fire
must not cause virtually instantaneous explosion of
almost the entire contents of the package.
Division 1 .5. Very insensitive explosives . This division
is comprised of substances that have a mass explosion

CHAPTER 3
OCCUPANCY CLASS IFICATION AND USE
User no te:
About this chapter: Chapter 3 provides the criteria by which buildings and structures are classified into use groups and occupancies.
Through the balance of the code, occupancy classification is fundamental in the setting of features of construction; occupant safety require?ments, especially building limitations; means of egress; fire protection systems; and interior finishes.
SECTION 301
SCOPE
301 .1 General. The provisions of this chapter shall control
the class ification of all buildings and structures as to occu?pancy and use. D ifferent classifications of occupancy and use
represent varying levels of hazard and risk to building occu?pants and adj acent properties .
SECTION 302
OCCUPANCY CLASSIFICATION

302.1 Occupancy classification. Occupancy classification is
the formal designation of the primary purpose of the building,
structure or portion thereof. S tructures shall be class ified into
one or more of the occupancy groups lis ted in this section
based on the nature of the hazards and risks to building occu?pants generally associated with the intended purpose of the
building or structure. An area, room or space that is intended
to be occupied at different times for different purposes shall
comply with all applicable requirements associated with such
potential multipurpose. S tructures containing multiple occu?pancy groups shall comply with S ection 508 . Where a struc?ture is proposed for a purpose that is not specifically listed in
this section, such structure shall be classified in the occu?pancy it most nearly resembles based on the fire safety and
relative hazard. Occupied roofs shall be class ified in the
group that the occupancy most nearly resembles , according to
the fire safety and relative hazard, and shall comply with Sec?tion 503 . 1 .4 .

CHAPTER 6
TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION
User no te:
About this chapter: Chapter 6 establishes five types of construction in which each building must be categorized. This chapter looks at the
materials used in the building (combustible or noncombustible) and the extent to which building elements such as building frame, roof, wall
and floor can resist fire. Depending on the type of construction, the specific building element and its proximity to a lot line, fire resistance of 1
to 3 hours is specified.
SECTION 601
GENERAL
601 .1 Scope. The provisions of this chapter shall control the
classification of buildings as to type of construction.

exterior walls shall have a fire-resistance rating not less than
that specified in Table 602. Where required to have a fire?resistance rating by Table 601 , building elements shall com?ply with the applicable provisions of Section 703 .2. The pro?tection of openings , ducts and air transfer openings in
building elements shall not be required unless required by
other provis ions of this code.
602.1 .1 M inimum requirements. A building or portion
thereof shall not be required to conform to the details of a
type of construction higher than that type which meets the
minimum requirements based on occupancy even though
certain features of such a building actually conform to a
higher type of construction.
602.2 Types I and II. Types I and II construction are those
types of construction in which the building elements listed in
Table 601 are of noncombustible materials , except as permit?ted in Section 603 and elsewhere in this code.
602.3 Type III. Type III construction is that type of construc?tion in which the exterior walls are of noncombus tible materi?als and the interior building elements are of any material
permitted by this code. Fire-retardant-treated wood framing
and sheathing complying with Section 2303 .2 shall be per?mitted within exterior wall assemblies of a 2-hour rating or
less .

CHAPTER 7
FIRE AND SMOKE PROTECTION FEATURES
User no te:
About this chapter: Chapter 7 provides detailed requirements for fire-resistance-rated construction, including structural members, walls, partitions
and horizontal assemblies. Other portions of the code describe where certain fire-resistance-rated elements are required. This chapter specifies
how these elements are constructed, how openings in walls and partitions are protected and how penetrations of such elements are protected.
SECTION 701
GENERAL
701 .1 Scope. The provisions of this chapter shall govern the
materials , sys tems and assemblies used for structural fire
resistance and fire-resistance-rated construction separation of
adj acent spaces to safeguard agains t the spread of fire and
smoke within a building and the spread of fire to or from
buildings .
SECTION 702 
MULTIPLE USE FIRE ASSEMBLIES
702.1 Multiple use fire assemblies . Fire assemb lies that
serve multiple purposes in a building shall comply with all of
the requirements that are applicable for each of the individual
fire assemblies.
SECTION 703
FIRE-RESISTANCE RATINGS AND FIRE TESTS
703 .1 Scope. Materials prescribed herein for fire resistance
shall conform to the requirements of this chapter.
703 .2 Fire-resistance ratings. The fire-resistance rating of
building elements , components or assemblies shall be deter?mined in accordance with the test procedures set forth in
ASTM E1 1 9 or UL 263 or in accordance with S ection 703 .3 .
The fire-resistance rating of penetrations and fire-resistant
joint systems shall be determined in accordance Sections 71 4
and 71 5 , respectively . 
703 .2.1 Nonsymmetrical wall construction. Interior
walls and partitions of nonsymmetrical construction shall
be tested with both faces exposed to the furnace, and the
assigned fire-resistance rating shall be the shortest dura?tion obtained from the two tes ts conducted in compliance
with ASTM E1 1 9 or UL 263 . Where evidence is furnished
to show that the wall was tested with the least fire-resistant
side exposed to the furnace, subj ect to acceptance of the
building official, the wall need not be sub j ected to tests
from the oppos ite s ide (see Section 705 . 5 for exterior
walls) .
703 .2.2 Combustible components. Combustible aggre?gates are permitted in gypsum and Portland cement con?crete mixtures for fire-resistance-rated construction. Any
component material or admixture is permitted in assem?blies if the resulting tested assembly meets the fire-resis?tance test requirements of this code.
703.2.3 Restrained classification. Fire-res istance-rated
assemblies tested under ASTM E1 1 9 or UL 263 shall not
be considered to be restrained unless evidence satisfactory
to the building official is furnished by the registered
design professional showing that the construction qualifies
for a restrained classification in accordance with ASTM
E1 1 9 or UL 263 . Res trained construction shall be identi?fied on the construction documents.
703.2.4 Supplemental features. Where materials , sys -
tems or devices that have not been tested as part of a fire?resistance-rated assembly are incorporated into the build?ing element, component or assembly, sufficient data shall
be made available to the building official to show that the
required fire-resistance rating is not reduced.
703.2.5 Exterior bearing walls . In determining the fire?resistance rating of exterior bearing walls , compliance
with the ASTM E1 1 9 or UL 263 criteria for unexposed
surface temperature rise and ignition of cotton waste due
to passage of flame or gases is required only for a period
of time corresponding to the required fire-resistance rat?ing of an exterior nonbearing wall with the same fire sepa?ration distance, and in a building of the same group .
Where the fire-resistance rating determined in accordance
with this exception exceeds the fire-resistance rating
determined in accordance with ASTM E1 1 9 or UL 263 ,
the fire exposure time period, water pressure and applica?tion duration criteria for the hose stream test of ASTM
E1 1 9 or UL 263 shall be based on the fire-resistance rat?ing determined in accordance with this section.
703.3 Methods for determining fire resistance. The appli?cation of any of the methods listed in this section shall be
based on the fire exposure and acceptance criteria specified in
ASTM E1 1 9 or UL 263 . The required fire resistance of a
building element, component or assembly shall be permitted
to be established by any of the following methods or proce?dures :
1 . Fire-resistance designs documented in approved
sources .
2 . Prescriptive designs of fire-res istance-rated building
elements , components or assemblies as prescribed in
Section 721 .
3 . Calculations in accordance with S ection 722.

spaces of hollow-core wall panels are filled with
loose-fill material, such as expanded shale, clay or
slag, or vermiculite or perlite, the fire-resistance rat?ing of the wall is the same as that of a solid wall of the
same concrete type and of the same overall thickness.
722.2.1 .1 .3 Tapered cross sections . The thickness
of panels with tapered cross sections shall be that
determined at a distance 2t or 6 inches (1 52 mm) ,
whichever is less , from the point of minimum thick?ness , where t is the minimum thickness .
722.2.1 .1 .4 Ribbed or undulating surfaces . The
equivalent thickness of panels with ribbed or undu?lating surfaces shall be determined by one of the fol?lowing expressions : 
For s ? 4t, the thickness to be used shall be t 
For s ? 2t, the thickness to be used shall be t
e
For 4t > s > 2t, the thickness to be used shall be 
(Equation 7-3)
where: 
s = Spacing of ribs or undulations . 
t = Minimum thickness .
t
e = Equivalent thickness of the panel calculated as
the net cross-sectional area of the panel divided
by the width, in which the maximum thickness
used in the calculation shall not exceed 2t.
722.2.1 .2 Multiwythe walls. For walls that cons ist of
two wythes of different types of concrete, the fire-resis?tance ratings shall be permitted to be determined from
Figure 722.2 . 1 .2 .
722.2.1 .2.1 Two or more wythes . The fire-resis?tance rating for wall panels cons isting of two or
more wythes shall be permitted to be determined by
the formula: 
R = (R1
0. 59 + R2
0. 59 + . . .+ Rn
0.59)
1 . 7 (Equation 7-4)
where: 
R = The fire endurance of the assembly, minutes .
R1
, R2
, and Rn = The fire endurances of the individual
wythes , minutes . Values of Rn
0.59 for use in Equation
7 -4 are given in Table 722.2 .1 .2(1 ) . Calculated fire?resistance ratings are shown in Table 722.2 . 1 .2(2) .
722.2.1 .2.2 Foam plastic insulation. The fire-resis?tance ratings of precast concrete wall panels con?s isting of a layer of foam plastic insulation
sandwiched between two wythes of concrete shall
be permitted to be determined by use of Equation 7-
4 . Foam plastic insulation with a total thickness of
less than 1 inch (25 mm) shall be disregarded. The
Rn
value for thickness of foam plastic insulation of 1
inch (25 mm) or greater, for use in the calculation, is
5 minutes; therefore Rn
0.59 = 2.5 . 
722.2.1 .3 Joints between precast wall panels. Joints
between precast concrete wall panels that are not insu?lated as required by this section shall be considered as
openings in walls. Uninsulated joints shall be included in
determining the percentage of openings permitted by
Table 705 .8 . Where openings are not permitted or are
required by this code to be protected, the provisions of
this section shall be used to determine the amount of joint
insulation required. Insulated joints shall not be consid?ered openings for purposes of determining compliance
with the allowable percentage of openings in Table 705 .8 .
722.2.1 .3 .1 Ceramic fiber joint protection. Figure
722 .2 .1 . 3 .1 shows thicknesses of ceramic fiber blan?kets to be used to insulate j oints between precast
concrete wall panels for various panel thicknesses
and for j oint widths of 3
/
8
inch (9 .5 mm) and 1 inch
(25 mm) for fire-resistance ratings of 1 hour to 4
hours . For joint widths between 3
/

and 1 inch (25 mm) , the thickness of ceramic fiber
blanket is allowed to be determined by direct inter?polation. Other tes ted and labeled materials are
acceptable in place of ceramic fiber blankets.

722.2.1 .4 Walls with gypsum wallboard or plaster
finishes . The fire-resistance rating of cast- in-place or
precast concrete walls with finishes of gypsum wall?board or plaster applied to one or both sides shall be
permitted to be calculated in accordance with the provi?s ions of this section.
722.2.1 .4.1 Nonfire-exposed side. Where the finish
of gypsum wallboard or plaster is applied to the s ide
of the wall not exposed to fire, the contribution of
the finish to the total fire-resistance rating shall be
determined as follows : The thickness of the finish
shall first be corrected by multiplying the actual
thickness of the finish by the applicable factor deter?mined from Table 722 .2 . 1 .4(1 ) based on the type of
aggregate in the concrete. The corrected thickness of
finish shall then be added to the actual or equivalent
thickness of concrete and fire-resistance rating of
the concrete and finish determined from Tables
722.2 . 1 . 1 and 722 .2 . 1 .2(1 ) and Figure 722.2 . 1 .2 .
722.2.1 .4.2 Fire-exposed side. Where gypsum wall?board or plaster is applied to the fire-exposed side of
the wall, the contribution of the finish to the total fire?resistance rating shall be determined as follows: The
time assigned to the finish as established by Table
722.2.1 .4(2) shall be added to the fire-resistance rat?ing determined from Tables 722.2.1 .1 and
722.2.1 .2(1 ) and Figure 722.2.1 .2 for the concrete
alone, or to the rating determined in S ection
722.2.1 .4.1 for the concrete and finish on the nonfire?exposed side.
722.2.1 .4.3 Nonsymmetrical assemb lies . For a wall
without finish on one side or having different types
or thicknesses of finish on each side, the calculation
procedures of Sections 722.2 .1 .4 .1 and 722.2 . 1 .4 .2
shall be performed twice, assuming either side of the
wall to be the fire-exposed s ide. The fire-resistance
rating of the wall shall not exceed the lower of the
two values . 
Exception: For an exterior wall with a fire separa?tion distance greater than 5 feet (1 524 mm) the fire
shall be assumed to occur on the interior side only.
722.2.1 .4.4 Minimum concrete fire-resistance rat?ing. Where finishes applied to one or both s ides of a
concrete wall contribute to the fire-resistance rating,
the concrete alone shall provide not less than one?half of the total required fire-resistance rating.
Additionally, the contribution to the fire resistance
of the finish on the nonfire-exposed side of a load?bearing wall shall not exceed one-half the contribu?tion of the concrete alone.
722.2.1 .4.5 Concrete finishes. Finishes on concrete
walls that are assumed to contribute to the total fire?resistance rating of the wall shall comply with the
installation requirements of Section 722 .3 .2 .5 .

(weaker) side.
722.6.2 Walls , floors and roofs. These procedures apply
to both load-bearing and nonload-bearing assemblies .
722.6.2.1 Fire-resistance rating of wood frame
assemblies . The fire-resistance rating of a wood frame
assembly is equal to the sum of the time assigned to the
membrane on the fire-exposed s ide, the time assigned
to the framing members and the time ass igned for addi?tional contribution by other protective measures such as
insulation. The membrane on the unexposed side shall
not be included in determining the fire resistance of the
assembly .
722 .6.2.2 T ime assigned to membranes. Table
722.6.2(1 ) indicates the time ass igned to membranes on
the fire-exposed side.
722.6.2.3 Exterior walls . For an exterior wall with a
fire separation distance greater than 1 0 feet (3048
mm) , the wall is assigned a rating dependent on the
interior membrane and the framing as described in
Tables 722 .6 .2(1 ) and 722 .6 .2(2) . The membrane on
the outside of the nonfire-exposed side of exterior walls
with a fire separation distance greater than 1 0 feet
(3048 mm) shall cons ist of sheathing , sheathing paper
and siding as described in Table 722 .6.2(3 ) .
722.6.2.4 F loors and roofs . In the case of a floor or

CHAPTER 1 0
MEANS OF EGRESS 
User no tes:
About this chapter: Chapter 10 provides the general criteria for designing the means of egress established as the primary method for protec?tion of people in buildings by allowing timely relocation or evacuation of building occupants. Both prescriptive and performance language is
utilized in this chapter to provide for a basic approach in the determination of a safe exiting system for all occupancies. It addresses all por?tions of the egress system (exit access, exits and exit discharge) and includes design requirements as well as provisions regulating individual
components. The requirements detail the size, arrangement, number and protection of means of egress components. Functional and opera?tional characteristics that will permit the safe use of components without special knowledge or effort are specified. 
The means of egress protection requirements work in coordination with other sections of the code, such as protection of vertical openings
(see Chapter 7), interior finish (see Chapter 8), fire suppression and detection systems (see Chapter 9) and numerous others, all having an
impact on life safety. Chapter 10 is subdivided into four main sections: general (Sections 1003–1015), exit access (Sections 1016–1021 ), exit
(Sections 1022–1027) and exit discharge (Section 1028). Special allowances for the unique requirements for assembly spaces (Section 1029)
and emergency escape and rescue openings (Section 1030) complete the chapter. Chapter 10 of this code is duplicated in Chapter 10 of the
In ternat ional F i re Code®
; however, the In ternat iona l F i re Code contains one additional section on maintenance of the means of egress system
in existing buildings.
Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [F] will be considered by the International

CHAPTER 1 1
ACCESS IB ILITY
User no te:
About this chapter: Chapter 11 contains provisions that set forth requirements for accessibility of buildings and their associated sites and
facilities for people with physical disabilities. The fundamental philosophy of the code on the subject of accessibility is that everything is
required to be accessible. This is reflected in the basic applicability requirement (see Section 1103.1 ). The code’s scoping requirements then
address the conditions under which accessibility is not required in terms of exceptions to this general mandate. While the IBC contains scop?ing provisions for accessibility (for example, what, where and how many), ICC A117.1 , Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities, is the
referenced standard for the technical provisions (in other words, how). Accessibility criteria for existing buildings are addressed in the In terna?tional Ex is ting Bu i ld ing Code®
. The In ternat iona l Res iden tial Code®
references Chapter 11 for accessibility provisions; therefore, this chapter
may be applicable to housing covered under the I n ternationa l Res iden tia l Code. The provisions in the I-Codes are intended to meet or exceed
the requirements in the federal accessibility requirement found in the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Act.
There are many accessibility issues that not only benefit people with disabilities, but also provide a tangible benefit to people without disabili?ties. This type of requirement can be set forth in the code as generally applicable without necessarily identifying it specifically as an accessi?bility-related issue. Such a requirement would then be considered as having been “mainstreamed.” For example, visible alarms are located in
Chapter 9 and accessible means of egress and ramp requirements are addressed in Chapter 10.

CHAPTER 1 5
ROOF ASSEMBLIES AND ROOFTOP STRUCTURES
User no tes:
About this chapter: Chapter 15 provides minimum requirements for the design and construction of roof assemblies and rooftop structures.
The criteria address the weather-protective barrier at the roof and, in most circumstances, a fire-resistant barrier. The chapter is largely pre?scriptive in nature and is based on decades of experience with various traditional materials, but it also recognizes newer products such as
photovoltaic shingles. Section 1510 addresses rooftop structures, which include penthouses, tanks, towers and spires. Rooftop penthouses
larger than prescribed in this chapter must be treated as a story under Chapter 5.
Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [BF], [BG] or [P] will be considered by one of the
code development committees meeting during the 2018 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. All other code change proposals will be considered
by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the 2019 (Group B) Code Development Cycle. See explanation on page iv.

CHAPTER 1 7 
SPEC IAL INSPECTIONS AND TESTS
User no tes:
About this chapter: Chapter 17 provides a variety of procedures and criteria for testing materials and assemblies, and labeling materials and
assemblies. Its key purposes are to establish where additional inspections/observations and testing must be provided, and the submittals and
verifications that must be provided to the building official. This chapter expands on the inspections of Chapter 1 by requiring special inspection
by a qualified individual where indicated and, in some cases, structural observation by a registered design professional. Quality assurance
measures that verify proper assembly of structural components and the suitability of the installed materials are intended to provide a building
that, once constructed, complies with the minimum structural and fire-resistance code requirements as well as the approved design. To deter?mine this compliance often requires frequent inspections and testing at specific stages of construction.
Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [BF] will be considered by the IBC—Fire
Safety Code Development Committee during the 2018 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. Sections preceded by the designation [F] will be
considered by the International Fire Code Development Committee during the 2018 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. All other code
change proposals will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the Group B cycle. See explanation on
page iv.

that account for soil-s tructure interaction, the deformed
shape of the soil support, the plate or stiffened plate action
of the s lab as well as both center lift and edge lift condi?tions . Such alternative methods shall be rational and the
bas is for all aspects and parameters of the method shall be
available for peer review.
1808.6.3 Removal of expansive soil . Where expans ive
soil is removed in lieu of des igning foundations in accor?dance with Section 1 808 .6. 1 or 1 808 .6 .2, the soil shall be
removed to a depth sufficient to ensure a constant moisture
content in the remaining soil. Fill material shall not con?tain expansive soils and shall comply w ith Section 1 804 .5
or 1 804.6 .
Exception: Expansive soil need not be removed to the
depth of constant mois ture, provided that the confining
pressure in the expansive soil created by the fill and
supported structure exceeds the swell pressure.
1808.6.4 Stab ilization. Where the active zone of expan?sive soils is stabilized in lieu of des igning foundations in
accordance with Section 1 808 .6 . 1 or 1 808 .6 .2, the soil

distance from the s lope to provide protection from slope
drainage, erosion and shallow failures . Except as provided
in Section 1 808 .7 .5 and Figure 1 808 .7 . 1 , the following cri?teria will be assumed to provide this protection. Where the
exis ting s lope is steeper than one unit vertical in one unit
horizontal (1 00-percent slope) , the toe of the s lope shall be
assumed to be at the intersection of a horizontal plane
drawn from the top of the foundation and a plane drawn
tangent to the s lope at an angle of 45 degrees (0.79 rad) to
the horizontal. Where a retaining wall is constructed at the
toe of the s lope, the height of the s lope shall be measured
from the top of the wall to the top of the s lope.
1808 .7.2 Foundation setback from descending slope
surface. Foundations on or adj acent to slope surfaces shall
be founded in firm material with an embedment and set
back from the s lope surface sufficient to provide vertical
and lateral support for the foundation without detrimental
settlement. Except as provided for in Section 1 808 .7 .5 and
Figure 1 808 .7 . 1 , the following setback is deemed adequate
to meet the criteria. Where the slope is s teeper than 1 unit
vertical in 1 unit horizontal (1 00-percent slope) , the
required setback shall be measured from an imaginary
plane 45 degrees (0.79 rad) to the horizontal, proj ected
upward from the toe of the slope.
1808 .7.3 Pools . The setback between pools regulated by
this code and slopes shall be equal to one-half the building
footing setback distance required by this section. That por?tion of the pool wall within a horizontal distance of 7 feet
(21 34 mm) from the top of the slope shall be capable of
supporting the water in the pool without soil support.
1808.7.4 Foundation elevation. On graded sites , the top
of any exterior foundation shall extend above the elevation
of the street gutter at point of discharge or the inlet of an
approved drainage device not less than 1 2 inches (305

HEADER AND G IRDER SPANSa, b FOR EXTER IOR BEAR ING WALLS
(Maximum spans for Doug las fi r-larch , hem -fi r, Sou thern p ine and spruce-pine-fi rb
and requ i red number of jack studs)
For S I: 1 inch = 25 .4 mm, 1 pound per square foot = 0 .0479 kPa.
a. Spans are given in feet and inches .
b . Spans are based on minimum des ign properties for No . 2 grade lumber of Douglas fir- larch, hem- fir, Southern pine and spruce-pine fir. 
c . Building width is measured perpendicular to the ridge. For widths between those shown, spans are permitted to be interpo lated.
d. NJ = Number of j ack studs required to support each end. Where the number of required j ack studs equals one, the header is permitted to be supported by an
approved framing anchor attached to the full-height wall stud and to the header.
e. Use 30 psf ground snow load for cases in which ground snow load is less than 3 0 psf and the roof live load is equal to or less than 20 psf. 
f. Spans are calculated assuming the top of the header or girder is laterally braced by perpendicular framing. Where the top of the header or girder is not laterally
braced (for example, cripple studs bearing on the header) , tabulated spans for headers consisting of 2 × 8 , 2 × 1 0 , or 2 × 1 2 sizes shall be multip lied by 0. 70 or
the header or g irder shall be designed.

multip ly by 0. 5 for framing spaced 1 2 inches on center.
c . The up lift connection requirements include an allowance for 1 0 pounds of dead load.
d. The up lift connection requirements do not account for the effects of overhangs . The magnitude of the loads shall be increased by adding the overhang loads
found in the table. The overhang loads are based on framing spaced 24 inches on center. The overhang loads given shall be multiplied by the overhang
pro j ection and added to the roof uplift value in the tab le .
e. The uplift connection requirements are based on wind loading on end zones as defined in Figure 28 . 5 -1 of ASCE 7 . Connection loads for connections located
a distance of 20 percent of the least horizontal dimens ion of the building from the corner of the building are permitted to be reduced by multiplying the table
connection value by 0. 7 and multiplying the overhang load by 0. 8 .
f. For wall-to-wall and wall- to- foundation connections , the capacity of the uplift connector is permitted to be reduced by 1 00 pounds for each full wall above.
(For examp le, if a 500-pound rated connector is used on the roof framing, a 400-pound rated connector is permitted at the next floor level down) .
g. Interpolation is permitted for intermediate values of Vasd and roof spans .
h. The rated capacity of approved tie-down devices is permitted to inc lude up to a 60-percent increase for wind effects where allowed by material specifications .

CHAPTER 24 
GLASS AND GLAZING
User no tes:
About this chapter: Chapter 24 establishes regulations for glass and glazing used in buildings and structures. Engineering and design
requirements are included in the chapter for glazing that is subjected to wind and snow loads. Another concern of this chapter is glass and
glazing used in areas where it is likely to be impacted by the occupants. Section 2406 identifies hazardous locations where glazing must
either be safety glazing or protected to prevent impacts by occupants. Safety glazing must meet stringent standards and be appropriately
marked or identified. Additional requirements are provided for glass and glazing in guards, handrails, elevator hoistways and elevator cars, as
well as in athletic facilities.
Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Commit?tee during the 2019 (Group B) Code Development Cycle. See explanation on page iv.
SECTION 2401
GENERAL
2401 .1 Scope. The provis ions of this chapter shall govern the
materials , design, construction and quality of glass , light?transmitting ceramic and light- transmitting plastic panels for
exterior and interior use in both vertical and s loped applica?tions in buildings and structures .
SECTION 2402
GLAZING REPLACEMENT
2402.1 General. The installation of replacement glass shall
