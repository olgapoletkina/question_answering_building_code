Through the balance of the code, occupancy classification is fundamental in the setting of features of construction; occupant safety requireno spacements, especially building limitations; means of egress; fire protection systems; and interior finishes. SECTION 301 SCOPE 301.1 General. The provisions of this chapter shall control the class ification of all buildings and structures as to occuno spacepancy and use. D ifferent classifications of occupancy and use represent varying levels of hazard and risk to building occuno spacepants and adj acent properties. SECTION 302 302.1 Occupancy classification. Occupancy classification is the formal designation of the primary purpose of the building, structure or portion thereof. S tructures shall be class ified into one or more of the occupancy groups lis ted in this section based on the nature of the hazards and risks to building occuno spacepants generally associated with the intended purpose of the building or structure. An area, room or space that is intended to be occupied at different times for different purposes shall comply with all applicable requirements associated with such potential multipurpose. S tructures containing multiple occuno spacepancy groups shall comply with S ection 508. Where a strucno spaceture is proposed for a purpose that is not specifically listed in this section, such structure shall be classified in the occuno spacepancy it most nearly resembles based on the fire safety and relative hazard. Occupied roofs shall be class ified in the group that the occupancy most nearly resembles, according to the fire safety and relative hazard, and shall comply with Secno spacetion 503. 1.4. 1. Assembly (see Section 303 ): Groups A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-5. 2. Business (see Section 304): Group B. 3. Educational (see Section 305 ): Group E. 4. Factory and Industrial (see Section 306): Groups F-1 and F-2. 5. High Hazard (see Section 307 ): Groups H-1, H-2, H-3, H-4 and H-5. 6.

S torage (see Section 3 1 1 ): Groups S -1 and S -2. 1 0. Utility and Miscellaneous (see Section 31 2): Group U. 302.2 Use designation. Occupancy groups contain subordino spacenate uses having similar hazards and risks to building occuno spacepants. Uses include, but are not limited to, those functional designations listed within the occupancy group descriptions in Section 302. 1. Certain uses require specific limitations and controls in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 and elsewhere in this code. SECTION 303 303.1 Assemb ly Group A. Assembly Group A occupancy includes, among others, the use of a building or structure, or a portion thereof, for the gathering of persons for purposes such as civic, social or religious functions; recreation, food or drink consumption or awaiting transportation. 303.1.1 Small buildings and tenant spaces.

Other portions of the code describe where certain fire-resistance-rated elements are required. This chapter specifies how these elements are constructed, how openings in walls and partitions are protected and how penetrations of such elements are protected. SECTION 701 GENERAL 701.1 Scope. The provisions of this chapter shall govern the materials, sys tems and assemblies used for structural fire resistance and fire-resistance-rated construction separation of adj acent spaces to safeguard agains t the spread of fire and smoke within a building and the spread of fire to or from buildings. SECTION 702 702.1 Multiple use fire assemblies. Fire assemb lies that serve multiple purposes in a building shall comply with all of the requirements that are applicable for each of the individual fire assemblies. SECTION 703 703.1 Scope. Materials prescribed herein for fire resistance shall conform to the requirements of this chapter. 703.2 Fire-resistance ratings. The fire-resistance rating of building elements, components or assemblies shall be deterno spacemined in accordance with the test procedures set forth in ASTM E1 1 9 or UL 263 or in accordance with S ection 703.3. The fire-resistance rating of penetrations and fire-resistant joint systems shall be determined in accordance Sections 71 4 and 71 5, respectively. 703.2.1 Nonsymmetrical wall construction. Interior walls and partitions of nonsymmetrical construction shall be tested with both faces exposed to the furnace, and the assigned fire-resistance rating shall be the shortest durano spacetion obtained from the two tes ts conducted in compliance with ASTM E1 1 9 or UL 263. Where evidence is furnished to show that the wall was tested with the least fire-resistant side exposed to the furnace, subj ect to acceptance of the building official, the wall need not be sub j ected to tests from the oppos ite s ide (see Section 705. 5 for exterior walls). 703.2.2 Combustible components. Combustible aggreno spacegates are permitted in gypsum and Portland cement conno spacecrete mixtures for fire-resistance-rated construction. Any component material or admixture is permitted in assemno spaceblies if the resulting tested assembly meets the fire-resisno spacetance test requirements of this code. 703.2.3 Restrained classification. Fire-res istance-rated assemblies tested under ASTM E1 1 9 or UL 263 shall not be considered to be restrained unless evidence satisfactory to the building official is furnished by the registered design professional showing that the construction qualifies for a restrained classification in accordance with ASTM E1 1 9 or UL 263. Res trained construction shall be identino spacefied on the construction documents. 703.2.4 Supplemental features. Where materials, sys - tems or devices that have not been tested as part of a fireno spaceresistance-rated assembly are incorporated into the buildno spaceing element, component or assembly, sufficient data shall be made available to the building official to show that the required fire-resistance rating is not reduced. 703.2.5 Exterior bearing walls. In determining the fireno spaceresistance rating of exterior bearing walls, compliance with the ASTM E1 1 9 or UL 263 criteria for unexposed surface temperature rise and ignition of cotton waste due to passage of flame or gases is required only for a period of time corresponding to the required fire-resistance ratno spaceing of an exterior nonbearing wall with the same fire sepano spaceration distance, and in a building of the same group. Where the fire-resistance rating determined in accordance with this exception exceeds the fire-resistance rating determined in accordance with ASTM E1 1 9 or UL 263, the fire exposure time period, water pressure and applicano spacetion duration criteria for the hose stream test of ASTM E1 1 9 or UL 263 shall be based on the fire-resistance ratno spaceing determined in accordance with this section. 703.3 Methods for determining fire resistance. The applino spacecation of any of the methods listed in this section shall be based on the fire exposure and acceptance criteria specified in ASTM E1 1 9 or UL 263. The required fire resistance of a building element, component or assembly shall be permitted to be established by any of the following methods or proceno spacedures: 1. Fire-resistance designs documented in approved sources. 2. Prescriptive designs of fire-res istance-rated building elements, components or assemblies as prescribed in Section 721. 3. Calculations in accordance with S ection 722. 4.

Alternative protection methods as allowed by S ection 1 04. 1 1. 6. Fire-resistance des igns certified by an approved agency. 703.4 Automatic sprinklers. Under the prescriptive fireno spaceresistance requirements of this code, the fire-resistance rating of a building element, component or assembly shall be estabno spacelished without the use of automatic sprinklers or any other fire suppress ion system being incorporated as part of the assembly tes ted in accordance with the fire exposure, proceno spacedures and acceptance criteria specified in ASTM E1 1 9 or UL 263. However, this section shall not prohibit or limit the duties and powers of the building official allowed by Sections 1 04. 1 0 and 1 04. 1 1. 703.5 Noncombustibility tests. The tests indicated in S ecno spacetions 703. 5. 1 and 703.5.2 shall serve as criteria for accepno spacetance of building materials as set forth in Sections 602.2, 602. 3 and 602.4 in Types I, II, III and IV cons truction. The term “noncombustible” does not apply to the flame spread characteristics of interior finish or trim materials. A material shall not be classified as a noncombustible building construcno spacetion material if it is subj ect to an increase in combustibility or flame spread beyond the limitations herein established through the effects of age, mois ture or other atmospheric conno spaceditions. 703.5.1 Elementary materials. Materials required to be noncombustible shall be tested in accordance with ASTM E1 36. 703.5.2 Composite materials. Materials having a strucno spacetural base of noncombustible material as determined in accordance with Section 703.5. 1 with a surfacing not more than 0. 1 25 inch (3. 1 8 mm) thick that has a flame spread index not greater than 50 when tested in accordance with ASTM E84 or UL 723 shall be acceptable as noncombusno spacetible materials. 703.6 Fire-resistance-rated glazing.

Calculated fireno spaceresistance ratings are shown in Table 722.2. 1.2(2). 722.2.1.2.2 Foam plastic insulation. The fire-resisno spacetance ratings of precast concrete wall panels conno spaces isting of a layer of foam plastic insulation sandwiched between two wythes of concrete shall be permitted to be determined by use of Equation 7- 4. Foam plastic insulation with a total thickness of less than 1 inch (25 mm) shall be disregarded. The Rn value for thickness of foam plastic insulation of 1 inch (25 mm) or greater, for use in the calculation, is 5 minutes; therefore Rn 0.59 = 2.5. 722.2.1.3 Joints between precast wall panels. Joints between precast concrete wall panels that are not insuno spacelated as required by this section shall be considered as openings in walls. Uninsulated joints shall be included in determining the percentage of openings permitted by Table 705.8. Where openings are not permitted or are required by this code to be protected, the provisions of this section shall be used to determine the amount of joint insulation required. Insulated joints shall not be considno spaceered openings for purposes of determining compliance with the allowable percentage of openings in Table 705.8. 722.2.1.3.1 Ceramic fiber joint protection. Figure 722.2.1. 3.1 shows thicknesses of ceramic fiber blanno spacekets to be used to insulate j oints between precast concrete wall panels for various panel thicknesses and for j oint widths of 3 / 8 inch (9.5 mm) and 1 inch (25 mm) for fire-resistance ratings of 1 hour to 4 hours. For joint widths between 3 / 8 inch (9.5 mm) and 1 inch (25 mm), the thickness of ceramic fiber blanket is allowed to be determined by direct interno spacepolation. Other tes ted and labeled materials are acceptable in place of ceramic fiber blankets.

Where the finish of gypsum wallboard or plaster is applied to the s ide of the wall not exposed to fire, the contribution of the finish to the total fire-resistance rating shall be determined as follows: The thickness of the finish shall first be corrected by multiplying the actual thickness of the finish by the applicable factor deterno spacemined from Table 722.2. 1.4(1 ) based on the type of aggregate in the concrete. The corrected thickness of finish shall then be added to the actual or equivalent thickness of concrete and fire-resistance rating of the concrete and finish determined from Tables 722.2. 1. 1 and 722.2. 1.2(1 ) and Figure 722.2. 1.2. 722.2.1.4.2 Fire-exposed side. Where gypsum wallno spaceboard or plaster is applied to the fire-exposed side of the wall, the contribution of the finish to the total fireno spaceresistance rating shall be determined as follows: The time assigned to the finish as established by Table 722.2.1.4(2) shall be added to the fire-resistance ratno spaceing determined from Tables 722.2.1.1 and 722.2.1.2(1 ) and Figure 722.2.1.2 for the concrete alone, or to the rating determined in S ection 722.2.1.4.1 for the concrete and finish on the nonfireno spaceexposed side. 722.2.1.4.3 Nonsymmetrical assemb lies. For a wall without finish on one side or having different types or thicknesses of finish on each side, the calculation procedures of Sections 722.2.1.4.1 and 722.2. 1.4.2 shall be performed twice, assuming either side of the wall to be the fire-exposed s ide. The fire-resistance rating of the wall shall not exceed the lower of the two values. Exception: For an exterior wall with a fire separano spacetion distance greater than 5 feet (1 524 mm) the fire shall be assumed to occur on the interior side only. 722.2.1.4.4 Minimum concrete fire-resistance ratno spaceing. Where finishes applied to one or both s ides of a concrete wall contribute to the fire-resistance rating, the concrete alone shall provide not less than oneno spacehalf of the total required fire-resistance rating. Additionally, the contribution to the fire resistance of the finish on the nonfire-exposed side of a loadno spacebearing wall shall not exceed one-half the contribuno spacetion of the concrete alone. 722.2.1.4.5 Concrete finishes.

The provisions of this chapter require materials used as interior finishes and decorations to meet certain flame spread index or flame propagation criteria and smoke development criteria based on the relative fire hazard associated with the occupancy. The performance of the material is evaluated based on test standards. Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [F] will be considered by the International Fire Code Development Committee during the 2019 (Group B) Code Development Cycle. See explanation on page iv. SECTION 801 SCOPE 801.1 Scope. The provisions of this chapter shall govern the use of materials used as interior finishes, trim and decorative materials. SECTION 802 GENERAL 802.1 Interior wall and ceiling finish. The provis ions of Section 803 shall limit the allowable fire performance and smoke development of interior wall and ceiling finish materino spaceals based on occupancy classification. 802.2 Interior floor finish. The provis ions of Section 804 shall limit the allowable fire performance of interior floor finno spaceish materials based on occupancy classification."

Its key purposes are to establish where additional inspections/observations and testing must be provided, and the submittals and verifications that must be provided to the building official. This chapter expands on the inspections of Chapter 1 by requiring special inspection by a qualified individual where indicated and, in some cases, structural observation by a registered design professional. Quality assurance measures that verify proper assembly of structural components and the suitability of the installed materials are intended to provide a building that, once constructed, complies with the minimum structural and fire-resistance code requirements as well as the approved design. To deterno spacemine this compliance often requires frequent inspections and testing at specific stages of construction. Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [BF] will be considered by the IBC—Fire Safety Code Development Committee during the 2018 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. Sections preceded by the designation [F] will be considered by the International Fire Code Development Committee during the 2018 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. All other code change proposals will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the Group B cycle. See explanation on page iv. SECTION 1 701 GENERAL 1701.1 Scope.
