Through the balance of the code, occupancy classification is fundamental in the setting of features of construction; occupant safety requireno spacements, especially building limitations; means of egress; fire protection systems; and interior finishes. SECTION 301 SCOPE 301.1 General. The provisions of this chapter shall control the class ification of all buildings and structures as to occuno spacepancy and use. D ifferent classifications of occupancy and use represent varying levels of hazard and risk to building occuno spacepants and adj acent properties. SECTION 302302.1 Occupancy classification. Occupancy classification is the formal designation of the primary purpose of the building, structure or portion thereof. S tructures shall be class ified into one or more of the occupancy groups lis ted in this section based on the nature of the hazards and risks to building occuno spacepants generally associated with the intended purpose of the building or structure. An area, room or space that is intended to be occupied at different times for different purposes shall comply with all applicable requirements associated with such potential multipurpose. S tructures containing multiple occuno spacepancy groups shall comply with S ection 508. Where a strucno spaceture is proposed for a purpose that is not specifically listed in this section, such structure shall be classified in the occuno spacepancy it most nearly resembles based on the fire safety and relative hazard. Occupied roofs shall be class ified in the group that the occupancy most nearly resembles, according to the fire safety and relative hazard, and shall comply with Secno spacetion 503.1.4.1.

Utility and Miscellaneous (see Section 312): Group U.302.2 Use designation. Occupancy groups contain subordino spacenate uses having similar hazards and risks to building occuno spacepants. Uses include, but are not limited to, those functional designations listed within the occupancy group descriptions in Section 302.1. Certain uses require specific limitations and controls in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 and elsewhere in this code. SECTION 303303.1 Assemb ly Group A.

Types I and II construction are those types of construction in which the building elements listed in Table 601 are of noncombustible materials, except as permitno spaceted in Section 603 and elsewhere in this code.602.3 Type III. Type III construction is that type of construcno spacetion in which the exterior walls are of noncombus tible materino spaceals and the interior building elements are of any material permitted by this code.

Accessibility criteria for existing buildings are addressed in the In ternano spacetional Ex is ting Bu i ld ing Code®. The In ternat iona l Res iden tial Code® references Chapter 11 for accessibility provisions; therefore, this chapter may be applicable to housing covered under the I n ternationa l Res iden tia l Code.

Engineering and design requirements are included in the chapter for glazing that is subjected to wind and snow loads. Another concern of this chapter is glass and glazing used in areas where it is likely to be impacted by the occupants. Section 2406 identifies hazardous locations where glazing must either be safety glazing or protected to prevent impacts by occupants. Safety glazing must meet stringent standards and be appropriately marked or identified. Additional requirements are provided for glass and glazing in guards, handrails, elevator hoistways and elevator cars, as well as in athletic facilities.
